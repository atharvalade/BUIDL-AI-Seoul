                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Rick Woldenberg thought he had come up with a sure-fire plan to protect his Chicago-area educational toy company from President Donald Trump´s massive new taxes on Chinese imports.\n\n\"When he announced a 20% tariff, I made a plan to survive 40%, and I thought I was being very clever,\" said Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a third-generation family business that has been manufacturing in China for four decades. \"I had worked out that for a very modest price increase, we could withstand 40% tariffs, which was an unthinkable increase in costs.\"\n\nHis worst-case scenario wasn´t worst-case enough. Not even close.\n\nThe American president quickly upped the ante with China, raising the levy to 54% to offset what he said were China´s unfair trade practices. Then, enraged when China retaliated with tariffs of its own, he upped the levies to a staggering 145%.\n\nWoldenberg reckons that will push Learning Resource´s tariff bill from $2.3 million last year to $100.2 million in 2025. \"I wish I had $100 million,\" he said. \"Honest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.\"\n\nIt might at least be the end of an era of inexpensive consumer goods in America. For four decades, and especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Americans have relied on Chinese factories for everything from smartphones to Christmas ornaments.\n\nRick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, an educational toy company whose products are manufactured in China, stands at a warehouse in Vernon Hills, Ill., Friday, April 11, 2025. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nAs tensions between the world´s two biggest economies - and geopolitical rivals - have risen over the past decade, Mexico and Canada have supplanted China as America´s top source of imported goods and services. But China is still No. 3 - and second behind Mexico in goods alone - and continues to dominate in many categories.\n\nChina produces 97% of America´s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children´s coloring books and 90% of its combs, according to a report from the Macquarie investment bank.\n\nOver the years, American companies have set up supply chains that depend on thousands of Chinese factories. Low tariffs greased the system. As recently as January 2018, U.S. tariffs on China averaged just over 3%, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\"American consumers created China,\" said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. \"American buyers, the consumers, got addicted to cheap pricing. And the brands and the retailers got addicted to the ease of buying from China.\"\n\nNow Trump, demanding that manufacturers return production to America, is swinging a tariff sledgehammer at the American importers and the Chinese factories they rely on.\n\n\"The consequences of tariffs at this scale could be apocalyptic at many levels,\" said David French, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Retail Foundation.\n\nThe Yale University Budget Lab estimates that the tariffs that Trump has announced globally since taking office would lower U.S. economic growth by 1.1 percentage points in 2025.\n\nThe tariffs are also likely to push up prices. The University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, out Friday, found that Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.\n\n\"Inflation´s going up in the United States,\" said Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and now at Yale Law School´s China Center. \"Consumers have figured this out as well.\"\n\nIt's not just the size of Trump´s tariffs that has businesses bewildered and scrambling; it´s the speed and the unpredictability with which the president is rolling them out.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House said the tariffs on China would hit 125%. A day later, it corrected that: No, the tariffs would be 145%, including a previously announced 20% to pressure China to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nChina in turn has imposed a 125% tariff on the U.S. effective Saturday.\n\n\"There is so much uncertainty,\" said Isaac Larian, the founder of MGA Entertainment, which makes L.O.L. and Bratz dolls, among other toys. \"And no business can run on uncertainty.\"\n\nHis company gets 65% of its product from Chinese factories, a share he is trying to winnow down to 40% by the end of the year. MGA also manufactures in India, Vietnam and Cambodia, but Trump is threatening to levy heavy tariffs on those countries, too, after delaying them for 90 days.\n\nLarian estimates that the price of Bratz dolls could go from $15 to $40 and that of L.O.L. dolls could double to $20 by this year's holiday season.\n\nEven his Little Tikes brand, which is made in Ohio, is not immune. Little Tikes depends on screws and other parts from China. Larian figures the price for its toy cars could rise to $90 from a suggested retail price of $65.\n\nHe said MGA would likely cut orders for the fourth quarter because he is worried that higher prices will scare off consumers.\n\nMarc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois, invested millions of dollars of his own money to develop $1,000 ergonomic chairs, which were to start production in China next month.\n\nNow´s he calling off production and exploring markets outside the U.S., including Germany and Italy, where his chairs wouldn´t face Trump´s triple-digit tariffs.\n\nHe had looked for ways to make the chairs in the United States and had discussions with potential suppliers in Michigan, but the costs would have been 25% to 30% higher.\n\n\"They didn´t have the skilled labor to do this stuff, and they didn´t have the desire to do it,\" Rosenberg said.\n\nWoldenberg´s company in Vernon Hills, Illinois, has been in the family since 1916. It was started by his grandfather as a laboratory supply company and evolved over the years into Learning Resources.\n\nThe company specializes in educational toys such as Botley: The Coding Robot and the brainteaser Kanoodle. It employs about 500 people - 90% in the United States - and makes about 2,400 products in China.\n\nWoldenberg is reeling from the size and suddenness of Trump´s tariffs.\n\n\"The products I make in China, about 60% of what I do, become economically unviable overnight,\" he said. \"In an instant, snap of a finger, they´re kaput.\"\n\nHe described Trump´s call for factories to return to the United States as \"a joke.\"\n\n\"I have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time ... and I have come up with zero companies to partner with,\" he said.\n\nThe tariffs, unless they´re reduced or eliminated, will wipe out thousands of small Chinese suppliers, Woldenberg predicted.\n\nThat would spell disaster for companies like his that have installed expensive tools and molds in Chinese factories, he said. The stand to lose not only their manufacturing base but also possibly their tools, which could get caught up in bankruptcies in China.\n\nLearning Resources has about 10,000 molds, weighing collectively more than 5 million pounds, in China.\n\n\"It´s not like you just bring in a canvas bag, zip it up and walk out,\" Woldenberg said. \"There is no idle manufacturing hub standing fully equipped, full of engineers and qualified people waiting for me to show up with 10,000 molds to make 2,000 products.\"\n\nD´Innocenzio reported from New York.\n\nProducts of Learning Resources, an educational toy company whose products are manufactured in China, are shown at a showroom in Vernon Hills, Ill., Friday, April 11, 2025.

                "body": "China has escalated rhetoric after Trump's new tariffs, reviving Xi Jinping's warning of a \"Great Wall of Steel\" and posting symbolic videos as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensify.\n\nThe war of words between Washington and Beijing has intensified following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping new tariffs. Although Trump has paused tariffs for 90 days for most nations, the measures targeting China remain firmly in place.\n\nIn a defiant move, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning shared a July 2021 video of President Xi Jinping on X, signalling Beijing's hardening stance. In the video, Xi delivers a stark warning to China's adversaries:\n\n\"We have never bullied, oppressed, or subjugated the people of any other country, and we never will. By the same token, Chinese people will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or subjugate us. Anyone who would attempt to do so will find themselves on a collision course with a great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people.\"\n\nThe message underlines China's growing resistance as it confronts the escalating trade conflict. As the world's second-largest economy and one of the United States' biggest trading partners, China has matched Trump's tariffs step for step in recent days.\n\nEarlier, Mao Ning had also posted an archival clip of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong referring to the United States as a \"paper tiger,\" invoking historic rhetoric to frame the ongoing tensions.\n\nOn Thursday, following Trump's announcement of a steep 125% tariff on Chinese imports, Beijing responded with clear defiance.\n\nThe dramatic escalation underscores the high-stakes nature of the trade war between the world's two largest economies.",

The Office for National Statistics found that the British economy grew by 0.5% in February, ahead of market expectations for a more modest increase of 0.2%. It also revised up January's figure to no change from the previous estimate of a 0.1% decline.\n\nWere these more normal times, hopes for the year ahead would be high. But the recent market turmoil prompted by Trump's tariff policies - and subsequent abrupt changes - is expected to lead to a downturn around the world, as businesses and consumers retrench in the face of the heightened economic uncertainty.\n\nChina's decision to raise tariffs on US goods from 84% to 125% from Saturday has only added to fears that the world's two biggest economies are heading for a drawn-out and damaging trade war.",

                "title": "Obama-Era Economist Jason Furman Says Trump Tariffs 'Now Higher & More Inflationary' Than Announced: Raising China Levies Outweighs 90-Day Delay On Others",
                "body": "Jason Furman, who served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under 44th President Barack Obama from 2013 to 2017, warned that U.S. tariffs have reached their highest levels in over a century and could prove more inflationary than initially anticipated, just as markets speculate about potential Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.\n\nWhat Happened: \"I don't think people realize that in important respects tariffs are now higher & more inflationary than what was announced last Wednesday,\" Furman, now a Harvard professor, wrote on X. \"Since then we've gone from 54% to 125% on China, our 3rd largest trading partner.\"\n\nFurman noted these increases \"outweigh delaying the increases on 70+ others.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe comments come amid market volatility following President Donald Trump's implementation of sweeping tariffs, which briefly went into effect before he announced a 90-day reprieve for non-retaliating countries.\n\nThe pause triggered Wall Street's strongest rally since 2008, with the S&P 500 tracked by SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) surging 9.52% and Nasdaq-100 tracked by Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) rocketing 12.2%.\n\nWhile China now faces steeper 125% tariffs, the market remains concerned about inflation implications ahead of Thursday's March Consumer Price Index report. Economists expect headline CPI to ease to 2.6% year-over-year, down from February's 2.8%.\n\nSee Also: How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\n\nWhy It Matters: CME FedWatch Tool shows an 83.0% chance the Fed will hold rates at 4.25-4.50% at its May 7 meeting, and a 17.0% chance of a cut to 4.00-4.25%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled caution, emphasizing the need for \"greater clarity\" before adjusting monetary policy. \"The tariffs are bigger than almost all forecasters expected,\" Powell noted, warning they could raise inflation with \"more persistent effects possible.\"",

                "title": "Trump's historic China tariffs spread pain through U.S. and global economies",
                "body": "President Donald Trump's rapid-fire trade war has set in motion a commercial rupture without precedent, which is rippling through the global economy in unpredictable and costly ways.\n\nThe triple-digit taxes that the president has imposed on Chinese products -- and China's retaliatory measures -- are expected to shrink trade between the world's two largest economies from a recent annual peak of nearly $700 billion to almost nothing.\n\nAfter more than a quarter-century of a love-hate relationship, the United States and China are on the verge of a commercial divorce. Yet some coveted Chinese products will continue finding their way to American customers via other nations that face lower U.S. trade barriers. And even as direct trade shrivels, the U.S. will remain dependent on Chinese components that are inside products made in countries such as Mexico, Thailand or Vietnam.\n\n\"We're entering a new phase, a broader strategic decoupling between our two economies. It's going to be painful. It's going to hit both economies. It's going to hit the global economy,\" said Myron Brilliant, a senior counselor at DGA Group, a business advisory firm.\n\nMany U.S. importers will be unable to quickly find alternatives for their Chinese suppliers, leaving them little choice but to pay the tariffs. Those extra costs will show up in higher prices for consumers or will erode profits, cutting into hiring and growth.\n\nOther companies are putting the brakes on operations, as tariff pain spreads across the United States.\n\nEarlier this week, Kim Bradley, chief operating officer for Highline United, a footwear maker in Dedham, Massachusetts, stopped a 20-foot shipping container full of women's footwear as it was about to be loaded aboard a ship in a Chinese port. Rather than pay a $60,000 tariff bill when it arrived in the United States, she returned it to her factory in Dongguan, China.\n\nWith Chinese goods now facing import taxes of 145 percent, the projected tariff exceeded the value of the shoes inside the container and was roughly 10 times what the company normally pays.\n\n\"It's going to be catastrophic for the industry,\" she said. \"I can't imagine that the president is going to let this devastation happen.\"\n\nThere is no way that a wholesaler with modest profit margins, like Highline, could absorb such a cost increase. Even routine import duties stress the company's cash flow. U.S. Customs officials, for example, automatically deduct import taxes and other fees from Highline's bank account less than a month after clearing its cargo into the United States. Yet it might be two or three months before Highline is paid by its customers.\n\nBradley has paused other shipments while hoping for an early trade war resolution. So many companies are canceling their Chinese orders that the shipping line she uses may not operate its next scheduled sailing from the port of Yantian on April 17.\n\nLike most in her industry, Bradley said she has no choice but to buy from China. In the past, Highline has experimented with importing some products from Vietnam. But suppliers there require larger minimum orders than the more flexible Chinese producers.\n\nWhile she endorses the president's stated goal of trade \"fairness,\" she sees little likelihood that footwear manufacturing could return to the United States, as he intends.\n\n\"People in the United States don't want to be making shoes,\" she said.\n\nWith the company's fate hanging on diplomatic talks that have not yet begun, Highline last week laid off two longtime employees, including one who had worked for the company for 11 years.\n\nTrump's sky-high tariffs represent \"an extinction level event\" for thousands of small companies, said Steven Lamar, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\n\nThe U.S.-China slugfest will dent growth in both nations and send shock waves around the globe. By year end, the U.S. economy, which began 2025 growing at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, will be almost dead in the water, according to economists from both Goldman Sachs and Oxford Economics.\n\nAs China's factories continue to hum, Chinese goods that would have gone to the U.S. will instead head for Europe and other markets, threatening them with the sort of job-killing shock that battered American workers in the first decade of this century.\n\nChina's retaliation for Trump's tariffs, featuring its own levies of 125 percent, will make itself felt on American farms and businesses.\n\nCommercial aircraft maker Boeing has roughly three dozen suppliers in China, which produce components for every one of its current models.\n\nSoybean and corn growers are worried about losing Chinese sales after Beijing's announcement Friday that it had raised its tariffs in response to Trump's latest move.\n\nChinese mines dominate global production and processing of exotic rare earth minerals such as gadolinium and yttrium. Earlier this month, the Chinese government announced new export restrictions on seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths.\n\nThe share price of GE Healthcare Technologies, which uses the Chinese materials in a contrast agent for MRIs, fell 14 percent in one day following the announcement.\n\nWithin a month or two, some U.S. companies may run short of magnets needed to produce electric vehicles.\n\nElsewhere, consumer electronics companies -- or other manufacturers that have signed long-term contracts with Chinese suppliers -- will be under the most pressure. China for the past 15 years has exported more laptops, mobile phones and tablets than all other nations combined, according to the Rhodium Group, a New York-based consultancy.\n\nU.S. companies could shift their orders to Vietnam and India. But adding production capacity there requires 12 to 24 months, according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Opening new plants in other countries would take even longer.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that he wants to reach a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to ease tensions. But there is little trust between the two sides after years of trade friction and fruitless negotiations.\n\n\"I'm not concerned. I think President Xi is a very smart guy, and I think we'll end up making a very good deal,\" the president told reporters.\n\nRather than a comprehensive agreement, Beijing and Washington should try to rebuild mutual confidence through a series of incremental improvements, according to two business executives who have recently spoken to Chinese officials and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nBoth sides have reason to favor a deal. On Wall Street, stocks and bonds lost ground last week while China's economy is struggling amid a hangover from a property bubble. Yet hard bargaining lays ahead.\n\n\"Any deal that is going to be acceptable to Beijing is going to need to involve a substantial rolling back of penalties, tariffs, at least to the status quo ante of January 20,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"What they're most desirous of is predictability and stability.\"\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war is likely to push the global economy perilously close to recession. Assuming Trump's 10 percent universal tariff remains in place, and taxes on Chinese goods ultimately settle around 60 percent, the conflict will knock about 0.4 percent off global growth, according to Neil Shearing, chief global economist for Capital Economics in London.\n\nThe impact could be more profound if the trade war morphs into a financial battle.\n\nIn February, the president ordered his Cabinet officers to identify ways of preventing U.S. capital from financing Chinese technology companies that aid China's military and intelligence industries.\n\nAmong the measures that the presidential memo proposed: evaluating the risks involved in allowing Chinese companies such as Alibaba and Baidu to continue listing their shares on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\n\"A shift from trade to financial conflict would be a material escalation and [would] force markets to price in the possibility of financial decoupling,\" Rory Green, chief China economist for TS Lombard in London, wrote in a research note Friday.\n\nThe open breach between Washington and Beijing comes after both nations spent years trying to reduce their mutual dependence. Under Xi's \"dual circulation\" strategy, China has tried to shrink its reliance on foreign inputs. Likewise, both the Biden and Trump administrations have promoted domestic production rather than rely on an adversary like China for critical products such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and rare earths.\n\nSevering direct trade links with China, however, does not mean that the U.S. will no longer be vulnerable to Chinese economic coercion. Solar panels from Southeast Asia contain silicon wafers made in China. And U.S. automakers indirectly import four times as much Chinese content as they buy directly, according to research presented at a Brookings Institution conference in 2023.\n\n\"We may decouple, but not de-risk,\" said economist Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"You can't eliminate all Chinese content.\"\n\nAs attention turns to the president's talk of making an unspecified deal with China, CEOs mourn the apparent end of decades of mutually profitable relations. Many companies, including Apple, Tesla and Starbucks, will remain in China to serve Chinese customers. Others have begun shifting their supply chains to locations that will face lower U.S. trade barriers.\n\nNo matter what the two leaders manage to work out later this year, the long period of U.S.-Chinese commercial cooperation has ended, according to many who follow the trans-Pacific relationship, including Aaron Friedberg, who advised then-Vice President Dick Cheney in the years after China joined the global trading system.\n\n\"We're in a whole different world,\" said Friedberg, a Princeton University professor. \"And the nature of the economic relationship between the United States and China is not going to be what it was.\"",

                "body": "STORY: China increased its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% on Friday, hitting back against President Donald Trump's decision to raise duties on goods from the world's second largest economy.\n\nThis upped the stakes in a trade war that threatens to upend global supply chains.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports remain at an effective rate of 145% even after Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause on dozens of countries.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump still wants to reach an agreement with Beijing and remains confident about the prospects.\n\n\"The president, as I said from the podium just a few days ago when I was up here, would be gracious if China intends to make a deal with the United States. If China continues to retaliate, it's not good for China.\"\n\n(FLASH)\n\nREPORTER: \"Why is he optimistic that China is going to make a deal. It wants to make a deal. If they're not talking, where's that optimism?\"\n\nLEAVITT: \"He's optimistic.\"\n\nThe head of the Word Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said the bilateral dispute could damage the global economy.\n\n\"Further escalation becomes tantamount to a shortening of bilateral trade between the two countries, a decoupling. The negative macroeconomic effects will not be confined to the U.S. and China alone, but will extend to other countries, especially the least developed nations. Of particular concern is the potential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines. A division of the global economy into two blocks could lead to long-term reduction in global real GDP by nearly seven percent.\"\n\nAs Chinese President Xi Jinping talked trade on Friday with Spain's prime minister in Beijing, his finance ministry called Trump's tariffs \"completely unilateral bullying and coercion.\"\n\nChina indicated this would be the last time it matched U.S. tariff rises but left the door open for other types of retaliation.\n\nAnalysts say the kerfuffle has raised the risk of a recession in the U.S. significantly, and a survey out Friday showed consumer confidence plunging though stocks finished the week higher.",

                "body": "Trump tariffs backfire on Elon Musk, as Tesla pulls U.S.-built models from China\n\nChristiaan Hetzner\n\nUpdated April 11, 2025 at 8:18 PM\n\nTesla has stopped taking orders for the Model S and Model X in China, which now face retaliatory 125% import duties levied by Beijing. Local customers are only able to choose from new cars still in inventory at its showrooms across the country. Fortunately, they are not in high demand so the damage to Tesla is minimal.\n\nThe Trump administration's trade war with China backfired for the president's senior advisor Elon Musk when Tesla was forced to pull two cars from its biggest growth market.\n\nHis electric vehicle manufacturer is no longer accepting orders for its premium Model S sedan and sibling Model X crossover. Both built exclusively in California for worldwide export, the duo are subject to the new 125% import duty Beijing slapped on U.S. goods in retaliation for Trump's own similarly punitive tariff imposed this week.\n\nSales of the two models are now only possible from the dwindling inventory of vehicles Tesla already shipped from its Fremont plant near San Francisco to Chinese showrooms across the country.\n\nThe decision comes as Trump, whom Musk backed in the election with over a quarter billion dollars, ignited a trade war with the entire world that caused markets to tank. On Wednesday, Trump blinked after his new regime of punitive tariffs had only been in effect for a few hours, blaming \"yippy\" markets.\n\nBut he held firm on his China tariffs, and Beijing has now responded in kind.\n\nTesla relies almost exclusively on its Shanghai factory for the Chinese market\n\nFortunately for investors, the damage is minimal. Current estimates suggest no more than 2,000 Model S and X units are at risk, a little more than a tenth of one percent of Tesla's global annual volume.\n\nFor one, Tesla doesn't rely on exports to China for its business. Much like other foreign brands that are major players in China, the overwhelming bulk of its sales come from vehicles locally built and sourced. In Tesla's case, it builds the Model Y and 3 in its Shanghai factory.\n\nTypically carmakers only export niche models to China that compete in segments so small the added costs of setting up a second assembly line, even in a market its size, simply cannot be justified economically.\n\nThis goes equally for flagship luxury cars like the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class as well as Musk's Model S and X.\n\nSecondly, the Tesla duo at this point are so old they barely factor at all into its business when compared with the newer Model 3 and Model Y. For example, the S has largely been sold unchanged since 2012, save for design tweaks often too minor for the layman to spot.\n\nTesla did not respond to a Fortune request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

                "body": "1\n\nChina announced higher tariffs to retaliate against President Donald Trump.\n\nWhat's new: A 125 percent tariff on all U.S. goods to take effect Saturday. Americans' confidence in the economy is plummeting, yet Trump's staunchest supporters are still standing by him.Consumer impacts: Tariffs on China may still raise prices on lots of things, from tech gadgets to furniture and smaller-scale items, too -- consider buying these things now.What workers are saying: We asked 500 manufacturing employees what Trump's tariffs will mean for their jobs. Here's what they said.\n\n2\n\nTrump officials defied an order to detail steps to return a deportee.\n\nThe latest: Officials said a federal judge's deadline today to outline plans to return a mistakenly deported man was \"impracticable.\" The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld orders for his return.In related news: A judge ruled today that Columbia protester Mahmoud Khalil is eligible for deportation -- a decision with implications for Trump's tactic of sending detainees to Louisiana.Also: Thousands are boycotting an airline over its unconventional deal with Homeland Security to operate deportation flights.\n\n3\n\nThe U.S. military removed the commander of its base in Greenland.\n\nWhat happened: After Vice President JD Vance visited the base two weeks ago, Col. Susan Meyers wrote to staff that the administration's concerns do not reflect those of the base.For context: Vance criticized Danish leadership during his visit as Trump teases taking U.S. control of the territory. The administration has also been purging senior military officers.\n\n4\n\nTrump's budget proposal could nearly halve NASA's science funding.\n\nWhat would be lost: Some planetary and astronomical missions, including goals to bring samples from Mars back to Earth. \"This is an extinction-level event,\" one space advocate said.Earlier this week: Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and astronaut and Trump's NASA administrator pick testified at a confirmation hearing as the agency faces a fork in the road.\n\n5\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said his agency will know what causes autism by September.\n\nIn a Cabinet meeting: The health secretary claimed a massive testing and research effort into the condition will be completed soon. Researchers worry the plan is designed to blame vaccines.Also: Some public health experts fear Kennedy may limit health-care access based on personal behavior after his comments about doughnuts and smoking during an interview this week.\n\n6\n\nLawyers aren't sure how to respond to Trump's threats.\n\nWhat's going on: The president for weeks has been targeting high-profile law firms that have challenged him and cutting deals with others. Some attorneys say they don't know what to do.Today: Trump announced he'd reached deals with five more law firms pledging $600 million in legal services for causes he supports.\n\n7\n\nAs a \"baby Catholic,\" Vance has stumbled into a clash with the pope.\n\nHow? The vice president's defense of \"America First\" policy through appeals to Christian texts has inflamed some in the church. In February, Pope Francis rebuked Vance's public theology.Yet: Vance has equally staunch defenders among conservative Catholics critical of the current papacy. Trump's policies have forced the closure of a Catholic refugee resettlement program.\n\nOne more thing ... Trump signaled he may soon deny federal funds to \"sanctuary cities,\" which he calls \"death traps.\" We fact-checked the evidence for that claim. Also: Are missteps and reversals undermining Trump's promise to restore competence to government?\n\nWant to stay on top of President Trump's first 100 days?

                "body": "WASHINGTON, United States - President Donald Trump insisted Friday that his tariff policy was \"doing really well\" despite China hiking levies on US goods to 125 percent in the spiraling trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nInvestors dumped US government bonds, the dollar tumbled and stocks seesawed after Beijing's retaliation against Trump deepened concerns on already traumatized global markets.\n\nTrump sent financial markets into a tailspin by announcing sweeping import taxes on dozens of trade partners last week, only to abruptly roll them back to 10 percent on Wednesday for 90 days -- while raising levies on goods from China.\n\n\"We are doing really well on our tariff policy,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network after China announced its latest hike.\n\n\"Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly,\" he wrote.\n\nThe White House said later that Trump remained \"optimistic\" about a deal with China, and added that 15 other countries have offers \"on the table\" during his 90-day pause in their tariffs.\n\nBut Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt added that \"the president made it very clear, when the United States is punched he will punch back harder.\"\n\nThe US and Beijing have been trading salvos of increasingly harsh tariffs since last week.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping gave his first major comments on the tensions on Friday, with state media quoting him as saying his country was \"not afraid.\"\n\nXi also said the European Union and China should \"jointly resist unilateral bullying practices\" during talks with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.\n\n'Numbers game'\n\nBeijing announced after Xi's comments that new tariffs of 125 percent on US goods would take effect Saturday -- almost matching the staggering 145 percent level imposed on Chinese goods coming into America.\n\nA Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said the United States bore full responsibility, deriding Trump's tariffs as a \"numbers game\" that \"will become a joke.\"\n\nBut China's finance ministry said tariffs would not go any higher in an acknowledgement that almost no imports are possible at the new level.\n\nTrump had reiterated on Thursday that he was looking to do a deal with Xi despite the mounting tensions.\n\n\"He's been a friend of mine for a long period of time. I think that we'll end up working out something that's very good for both countries,\" he told reporters.\n\nBut US officials have made it clear they expect Xi to reach out first.\n\nPressure was growing on Trump, however, as markets continued to fret.\n\nYields on crucial US government bonds, which are normally seen as a safe haven, were up again Friday, indicating weaker demand as investors take fright.\n\nThe White House said however that it had no evidence to support speculation by traders that China was offloading some of its vast holdings -- which increase the cost of borrowing for the US government -- in retaliation.\n\nPolicymakers at the US Federal Reserve meanwhile warned of higher inflation and slower growth ahead due to Trump's tariff policy.\n\n'Countermeasures'\n\nEconomists warn that the disruption in trade between the tightly integrated US and Chinese economies will increase prices for consumers and could spark a global recession.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, an analyst at Swissquote bank, told AFP the tariff figures were \"so high that they don't make sense anymore,\" but said China was \"now ready to go as far as needed.\"\n\nThe rest of the world is still calibrating its response.\n\nTrump on Thursday described the European Union -- which was originally hit with 20 percent tariffs by Trump -- as \"very smart\" for refraining from retaliatory levies.\n\nTop EU officials and Chinese leaders are set to hold their next summit marking 50 years of ties in China in July, Brussels announced. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic will meanwhile hold talks in Washington on Monday.\n\nBut the 27-nation bloc's chief Ursula von der Leyen told the Financial Times on Friday that it remained armed with a \"wide range of countermeasures\" including a possible hit on digital services that would strike US tech firms. -- Agence France-Presse",

                "body": "When President Donald Trump announced a wide range of tariffs on April 2, Matt Rollens says he felt the entire room's mood shift.\n\n\"It was pretty shocking,\" says Rollens, who was surrounded by hundreds of fellow business owners at a trade show in Las Vegas at the time. \"It definitely put a big damper on everyone's mood, for sure. Everyone was worried about it, thinking about [the announcement]. And then when it happened, it was like, 'Oh, my God. [It's] way worse than anybody anticipated.'\"\n\nWhile many of those country-specific tariffs have since been paused for at least 90 days, the Trump administration on Wednesday placed additional tariffs on goods coming to the U.S. from China, climbing to a total rate of 145%.\n\nRollens, 39, is among the many American business owners reckoning with the implications of that price hike. He's the owner and CEO of Granite Bay, California-based novelty drinkware company Dragon Glassware, which employs four people full-time and averages roughly $5 million in annual revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.\n\nThe business makes and sells branded drinkware, from cocktail glasses to stainless steel tumblers, tied to popular film and television franchises, like \"Barbie\" and \"Wicked.\" It sells primarily through retailers like Amazon and Walmart, and like many small American retail businesses, its products are manufactured in Chinese factories.\n\nAhead of Trump's April 2 announcement, Rollens prepared for higher business costs and thought about how long he could \"eat the cost\" of tariffs higher than 20%.\n\nAt 145%, the burden is untenable, he says: The China tariffs are a \"doomsday scenario for small businesses ... which will put most of us out of business within months.\"",

                "body": "Apple is once again in the crosshairs of a global trade war. This time, the stakes may be even higher.\n\nOn April 2, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on a wide range of imported goods, including those from China, India, Vietnam and other countries critical to Apple's supply chain. That move sent shockwaves through global markets, wiping out over $640 billion in Apple's market value in just five days.\n\n\"It's the most head-scratching, absurd policy move we've seen in years,\" said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \"Apple is in the eye of the storm.\"\n\nCNBC technology reporter Kif Leswing calls it a \"massive moment for Apple.\"\n\n\"Even with all their efforts to diversify production, the company still depends on China, and now they're facing tariffs from nearly every country they manufacture in,\" Leswing said.\n\nWhile the stock rebounded on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for select nations, the broader uncertainty around Apple's global manufacturing model hasn't gone away. China tariffs remain at a staggering 145%.\n\n\"No company is more impacted by this tariff Armageddon than Apple,\" Ives said.\n\nApple still assembles 90% of its iPhones in China, largely through its partnership with Foxconn. China also handles 80% of iPads and over half of Mac computers, according to Evercore ISI.\n\n\"Apple's been trying to get ahead of this,\" Leswing said. \"They've been making iPhones in India, assembling Macs in Malaysia, sourcing from Vietnam, but those countries are now seeing tariffs too. That puts Apple in a really tough spot.\"\n\nIndia, Vietnam and Thailand were all key parts of Apple's post-COVID diversification strategy. Under Trump's new plan, imports from many of those countries face tariffs as high as 26% to 46%, although the president reduced most tariffs to 10% on Wednesday.\n\nStill, the message from the White House is clear: Apple needs to make products in the U.S.\n\nIn theory, tariffs are meant to bring jobs and production back to the U.S. In practice, moving high-tech manufacturing out of China is neither fast nor cheap.\n\n\"If you want an iPhone made in the U.S. and you want it for $3,500, we should make it here,\" said Ives. \"If you want it for $1,000, you keep it in China.\"\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max currently starts at $1,199, but one UBS estimate shows that new tariffs could raise the price by $350. Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley estimates Apple may need to increase prices across the board by 17% to 18% to cover the added cost.\n\nApple has started building some iPhones in India and iPads in Vietnam, but the company remains heavily reliant on China's infrastructure, skilled labor force, and dense manufacturing network.\n\n\"It would take decades just to move 10% of Apple's supply chain to the U.S.,\" Ives said. \"The global supply chain is built in Asia.\"\n\nAs panic rippled through the markets, Apple kept quiet. The company has declined to comment publicly on the tariffs and has offered no updated guidance to suppliers or shareholders.\n\nThat stands in contrast to 2019, when CEO Tim Cook personally lobbied the first Trump administration to exempt iPhones from a previous round of tariffs, and succeeded. This time, no carve-outs have been announced.\n\n\"It's kind of a cipher right now, what Tim Cook is cooking up in Cupertino,\" said Leswing. \"They've said very little.\"\n\nAccording to reporting from 9To5Mac, Apple has started modeling out different tariff scenarios and even chartered at least five planes in late March to stockpile products before tariffs took effect.\n\nAnalysts say Apple's options are limited in the short term. The company is expected to delay price hikes until its next product cycle, likely with the iPhone 17, but that could impact demand in a cooling smartphone market.\n\nApple already faces pressure over its slow rollout of artificial intelligence features and stagnating hardware innovation. If the tariffs remain in place, or escalate further, the ripple effects could be massive.\n\n\"This could throw the U.S. into a self-inflicted recession,\" Ives said.\n\nSo far, investors are watching closely for signs of a shift in strategy or a more forceful response from Apple leadership.\n\n\"Apple is the poster child for the trade war,\" said Leswing. \"And right now, they're not saying much at all.\"\n\nWatch the video to understand how tariffs are shaking Apple's supply chain and what it could mean for your next iPhone.",

JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo were among the reports, which mostly showed major U.S. banks beat forecasts for the first quarter.\n\nMarkets have been rocked by the global trade war and worries about recession since U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs late on April 2.\n\nOn Friday, China hit back, hiking its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, from 84%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 67.71 points, or 0.14%, to 39,647.37, the S&amp;P 500 rose 14.71 points, or 0.28%, to 5,282.76 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 75.17 points, or 0.44%, to 16,458.73.\n\nTechnology led S&amp;P 500 sector gains.\n\n\"A lot of de-risking has happened in the (tech) space and investors don't want to take too much risk of being too underweight in those areas,\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 1.56 points, or 0.20%, to 777.71. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.13%.\n\nIn the Treasury market, analysts said hedge funds and other asset managers offloaded bonds this week after getting margin calls and posting sharp losses from market volatility.\n\nStrong auctions of 10-year and 30-year debt on Wednesday and Thursday helped stabilize the market somewhat, but many investors remain wary of buying bonds until there is further improvement in liquidity.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 14.3 basis points to 4.535%.\n\nEarlier, euro zone bond yields eased, and the premium that holders of Treasuries demand to hold U.S. debt rather than German Bunds rose by the most in a week since the 1990s.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, fell 0.41% to 100.11, with the euro up 1.07% at $1.1317.\n\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.61% to 143.61.\n\nAgainst the Swiss franc, the dollar weakened 0.87% to 0.816.\n\nSpot gold was up 1.8% at $3,230.75 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $3,237.56 earlier in the session.

                "title": "How Should China Respond to Trump's Tariffs? - Opinion",
                "body": "US President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement of sweeping new tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries will be remembered as a man-made economic tsunami.\n\nMany are already comparing it to President Herbert Hoover's 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which slashed global trade by 66% in five years and deepened the Great Depression. Trump's tariffs - most of which have been abruptly paused for 90 days - have rattled financial markets, prompting analysts to warn that the United States could enter a recession in 2025.\n\nThe global implications can hardly be underestimated. As the world's largest economy, the US has an outsize impact on other countries' exports and growth. Adding to the uncertainty is Trump's erratic approach to policymaking, which is nurturing doubts about the US dollar's viability as a global reserve currency.\n\nEven more alarmingly, as the US withdraws from its international commitments, the world risks falling into the \"Kindleberger trap\" - a scenario reminiscent of the 1930s, when no major power was able or willing to provide the global public goods necessary to sustain the world economy. If current trends persist, the international economic architecture the US helped build 80 years ago could unravel.\n\nHow should other economies respond to Trump's tariffs? China, Canada, and the European Union have already announced retaliatory measures, while others have signaled a willingness to negotiate. For many, the US is not just a major export market but also a critical security partner and geopolitical ally.\n\nGiven its status as the world's second-largest economy and the largest trading country, China's response is especially consequential. While Trump has imposed new tariffs on nearly every country, China is clearly his primary target. During his first term, he launched an investigation into China's trade practices and imposed sweeping tariffs on a broad range of Chinese goods - many of which were later retained by Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe same tit-for-tat dynamic that characterized Trump's first trade war is playing out again. Within 48 hours of the US announcing a 34% tariff on Chinese imports - on top of a previous 20% increase - China's government responded by matching Trump's tariffs and introducing a set of more targeted measures. In turn, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%, prompting China to hike its own tariffs on US imports to 84%. Trump then escalated further, raising the rate on Chinese goods to 125% even as he put Liberation Day on hold.\n\nWhile Chinese experts hold differing views about how to respond to Trump's tariffs, many believe that offering concessions would only invite further US aggression, and the decision to raise its tariff on imports from the US to 125% reflects this view. Nonetheless, one hopes the two sides will be able to find ways to de-escalate through dialogue.\n\nBeyond tariffs, Chinese policymakers should focus on more strategic responses in three key policy areas. First, they must do more to boost economic growth. After two years of relatively weak performance, the government finally adopted more aggressive macroeconomic stimulus policies in September, leading to a significant acceleration in growth during the final quarter of 2024.\n\nBut the newly announced US tariffs could make it difficult for China to achieve its targets of 5% GDP growth and 2% inflation, as a decline in exports may reduce aggregate demand, exacerbate industrial overcapacity, and intensify deflationary pressures. Given the potential impact of the new US tariffs, Chinese policymakers will need to implement bold and well-targeted macroeconomic policies. The People's Bank of China should consider further monetary easing, including cutting its policy interest rate and the banks' reserve ratio.\n\nTo be sure, concerns about financial stability limit the scope for currency depreciation. There is broad consensus among Chinese analysts that fiscal policy - especially increased deficit spending by the central government - should play a greater role in supporting growth.\n\nSecond, the new US tariffs underscore the need to rebalance China's economy by strengthening domestic consumption. Currently, consumption accounts for only about 56% of GDP - nearly 20 percentage points below the global average - exacerbating China's overcapacity problem.\n\nHistorically, China addressed this imbalance by relying heavily on export demand. But that strategy has become increasingly unsustainable since the 2008 financial crisis, as global demand has weakened. Consequently, Chinese policymakers have introduced the \"dual circulation\" strategy to boost domestic demand and reduce dependence on foreign markets.\n\nIn March, the government unveiled a new series of \"special initiatives\" aimed at boosting consumption. But this is inherently more difficult than stimulating investment, as household spending is largely driven by income and confidence, both of which take time to rise.\n\nLastly, America's regrettable protectionist turn threatens to create a global leadership vacuum. Over the past few decades, many countries - particularly in Western Europe and East Asia - have benefited enormously from open markets. China must work together with these countries, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to preserve this system and bolster free trade and investment.\n\nOver the past year, the Chinese government has taken unilateral steps to facilitate international exchange, including visa-free travel for citizens of countries like Denmark, Norway, and South Korea. Similar measures could be extended to trade and investment.\n\nEncouragingly, Chinese policymakers have already made progress in each of these three areas. As the world enters a new phase of development, it is in China's best interest to get its own house in order first - and then take a proactive role in safeguarding the global economy.",

                "body": "China on Friday struck back at President Trump's ballooning tariffs, raising its duties on imports of US goods to 125% from 84%.\n\nThe countermeasures will come into effect Saturday, further intensifying a US-China trade war that has roiled US stocks. The trade conflict has weighed on investor sentiment, even as Trump instituted a 90-day pause on steep Liberation Day tariffs and the EU matched a US pause on retaliatory duties.\n\nThe Trump administration warned Chinese officials against retaliation before the measures were announced and said that Chinese President Xi Jinping should request a call with President Trump, CNN reported Friday.\n\nBeijing hinted it would not engage in further tariff hikes -- even if Washington continues its escalations.\n\nThe White House clarified on Thursday that US tariffs on Chinese imports are now at least 145%, not the 125% that Trump had said previously.\n\nTrump and members of his Cabinet attempted to reassure investors that things would \"work out\" with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he was confident the US would be in a place of \"great certainty\" after the \"pause\" as the administration looks to negotiate new trade deals with partners.\n\nMeanwhile, the baseline 10% tariff that went into effect on April 5 remains in place for all affected imports into the U.S.\n\nIn terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), compliant goods are imported tariff-free when traded among the three countries, while non-compliant goods are tariffed at 25% -- except for energy and potash, which are tariffed at 10%.\n\nHere are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.",

                "body": "Investing.com -- Despite a tariff reprieve from U.S. President Donald Trump that sent global markets soaring on Wednesday, China, which received no exemptions but rather a rise in tariffs, and the U.S. continue to escalate their ongoing tariff dispute.\n\nChina raised its import tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% on Friday. This duty, an increase from the 84% announced by Beijing on Wednesday, is the latest escalation in the intensifying trade war between the U.S. and China and will take effect on Saturday, Beijing said.\n\nCNN, citing sources, reported that just hours before China announced its retaliatory tariffs on Friday in response to Trump's increase, the U.S. administration warned China against such a move, suggesting instead that Chinese President Xi Jinping request a call with Trump.\n\nThe trade war is expected to escalate further, as Xi stood firm, with state broadcaster CCTV quoting him as saying China \"is not afraid of any unjust suppression,\" according to CNN.\n\nInvestors breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday when Trump announced a 90-day pause and a substantial reduction in tariffs to 10% for most trading partners. Previously, Trump's tariffs applied to over 180 countries, giving countries more time to negotiate with the U.S., with officials noting that dozens of countries have approached them seeking deals. Trump and his administration have claimed that the pause was in his plan all along, serving as an attempt to isolate China from global trade and bring them to the negotiation table.\n\nIn Trump's Wednesday announcement, he stated, \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other countries, are no longer sustainable or acceptable.\" China has called the U.S.'s continual raising of tariffs \"unilateral bullying and coercion.\"\n\nChina reportedly did not reach out to schedule a call between the two presidents, and the tariff escalation was seemingly a surprise to the Trump administration, given their warnings. U.S. officials told CNN that the country will not reach out to China first, with Trump reportedly instructing his administration that China must make the initial move.\n\nOfficials suspect Xi does not want to appear weak by reaching out first. Trump, however, suggested he might be open to dialogue, saying, \"China wants to make a deal. They just don't know quite how to go about it,\" during a Wednesday event at the White House. \"You know, it's one of those things - they're proud people.\"",

                "body": "Apple is the hardest hit U.S. technology company by President Donald Trump's hiked-up tariffs on China, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. While Trump this week scaled back tariff plans on most other countries, he's pushed the levy on China up to 145%. China has raised its tax on goods from the U.S. to 125% in response, bolstering fears of a burgeoning trade war between the two large countries. \"No [U.S.] tech company is more negatively impacted by these tariffs than Apple,\" Ives wrote to clients on Friday. About 90% of iPhones are manufactured and assembled in China, according to the analyst. If these tariffs remain in place for more than a few weeks, he said U.S. consumers can see iPhone prices to jump to at least $2,000. Beyond the iconic smartphone, Ives estimated that more than 50% of Apple's Macs and between 75% and 80% of its iPads are also produced in China. \"Apple has diversified its supply chain to other parts of the world,\" he added, citing Vietnam, India and the U.S. as examples. But, \"the hearts and lungs of the Apple supply chain are cemented in Asia.\" AAPL 1M mountain Apple shares in April Ives' estimate comes as Wall Street and Silicon Valley wonder how Apple will respond to the stark change in trade policy, which the analyst referred to as an \"Armageddon.\" Apple shares have tumbled more than 14% so far in April, making it the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven during this period. The White House asserted this week that the U.S. is up to the task of producing the iPhone domestically , but supply chain experts and analysts have said that is a highly unlikely outcome of the tariffs. Ives previously said that a U.S.-made iPhone would cost around $3,500 . \"Apple is in the eye of this storm,\" Ives wrote. \"Cupertino has no choice but to price iPhones at $2k+ if these tariffs stick for more than a few weeks.\" Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

China has denounced the policy as \"economic bullying\" and promised countermeasures. The new tariffs begin on Saturday.\n\nExperts have claimed that there are still more options if U.S. President Donald Trump keeps upping the ante. Experts have also claimed that China's yuan could weaken, making its exports more affordable, but there are limits to how far Beijing is willing to depreciate the currency, which would weaken investment returns and strain markets further, as per a report.\n\nExperts are watching for signs of whether negotiations might happen. Chinese officials have repeatedly said they are open to talks, but it's unclear whether Beijing is open to making any concessions, AP reported.\n\n\"The door is open for talks,\" said Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yongqian, \"but dialogue must be conducted on an equal footing and on the basis of mutual respect; and China will fight to the end,\" Yongqian said.\n\nPresident Xi managed to limit the damage from Trump's first term, when he launched tariff hikes and other sanctions to try to win more favorable trade terms for U.S. products. As head of the ruling Communist Party, he has won praise from Trump himself for his stance as a strongman and has plenty of experience in political maneuvering, as per the AP report.\n\n\"China is unlikely to change its strategy: stand firm, absorb pressure, and let Trump overplay his hand\" writes Daniel Russel, vice president of international security and diplomacy at the New York-based Asia Society Policy Institute. \"Beijing believes Trump sees concessions as a weakness, so giving ground only invites more pressure.\"\n\nQ1.

                "body": "To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.\n\nWell, most investors looked for clarity about where President Trump's trade agenda was heading. Our next guest accurately predicted that Trump's tariffs were really all about China. Joining us now, David Wu, a former top Wall Street global macro strategist, current CEO of David Wu Unbound where David publishes his research. And David, you accurately predicted a few days ago that the entire trade war would be about China. What is your message to investors about where we head from here then, given that clarity?\n\nYeah, I think, I think, I think that's the thing. I think, you know, the point here is that not only, I think, this whole entire trade war, the prime target was China, but rather, I think, at this point, I think, safe to say that the entire trade war has been designed by the architect of the Trump's trade war to literally deal a blow to the Chinese economy so hard that China would no longer be able to threaten the US hegemony. In fact, if you think about this, 125% tariff, I mean, we were to apply the sort of the traditional estimate on the price elasticity of imports, okay? This will suggest that with this tariff, Chinese exports to US will go to zero. We're not talking about down 30%, 40%. We'll literally go to zero over time. So I think from that point of view, there's no doubt. I think the Chinese are waking up to this realization, which is that this is not just a trade war. That this goes way beyond it. And I think my view is that the deep seek news in many ways, two months ago, have only galvanized the China hawks in Washington who believe that literally that China is an existential threat that has to be dealt with urgently. And I think these people right now, no doubt, are in the driver's seat.\n\nSo David, what investment thesis does the scenarios you just laid out create?\n\nI think right now, obviously, there's no doubt. I mean, this is where there'll be several rounds. This very first round, I would say, Trump won. No doubt about that, especially given I think Trump has access. If there's one success we can attribute to Trump, is the fact he's actually isolated China. The fact is that today, as you know, the European Union has basically decided to postpone the imposition of the $26 billion tariff that they only approved yesterday by 90 days, okay? And moreover, Japan and South Korea have denied that they were ever in negotiation with China about basically doing a free trade zone, okay? Even Brazil and India that are members of the BRICS have basically come out essentially closing the door on cooperation with China. So, and so forth. So I would say China definitely is very isolated at this point. The question then is what does China do? Because I think Xi Jinping right now has only two choices. Either he accepts defeat and sue for peace, or he really steps it up and try to punch back in some other way that's not economic. Okay? And I think that's really the issue and this is the reason why gold prices has done so well because I think the consequence of this trade war is that geopolitical risk has risen sharply.\n\nSo David, what does China do next to retaliate? What are their options?\n\nI think there are, there are several options. None of which is very pleasant, but let's just say but I think an economic realm, they don't really have many options, right? Because even when it comes to like selling Treasuries, I mean, let's be honest, most of central banks' holding of Treasuries are housed at the New York Fed. I'm telling you at the first time that China's trying to liquidate the treasure holdings. I mean, China run the risk of having their holdings being frozen by by by by the New York Fed or by Trump and so on. And so on. And they know that. So that's not really the thing to do. And then also because, I mean, Chinese imports from the US has been falling over the last five years. So that even today like China's, you know, China only imports about 20% of US export of soybeans, okay? So even there, I would say China doesn't have that much leverage. Again, I think I'm thinking in geopolitical terms what China can do to potentially hurt the US. I think one country that comes to mind obviously is Iran. Mhm. As you know, the US will be meeting with Iran, okay, on Saturday. And Trump says that he's optimistic that the two countries are moving forward in terms of averting US bombing of Iran's nuclear facility. As you know, China is Iran's largest oil, you know, basically importer. Right. About 99% of Iranian oil goes to basically China. China has a security agreement with Iran. China is Iran's arguably biggest backer. If I'm China right now, I might not want to basically, I want to basically bolster Iran's back, you know, in order to basically use Iran as a leverage in my negotiation with Trump. Yeah. So I would argue, all else being equal, I think the situation between US and China today means less likely that you're going to see the Iranian signaling any kind of willingness to negotiate with Trump this Saturday, which I think's bullish for oil in the short. Yeah. I think they are, of course, is Taiwan.\n\nSorry to interrupt you, but we've got 30 seconds left and I want to get your picks for our investor audience listening. How should investors be investing off of the ideas that you're laying out? 30 seconds.\n\nYeah. So I, I like gold. I think gold could potentially go even higher because I think a lot of central banks are going to be diversifying out of dollar into gold. That would be the right thing to do. I think the second thing is I think defense stocks are going to be very attractive as you know, like I think as the China hawks, the Russia hawks, you know, essentially make a comeback in Washington, already Senate and in the house, both want to increase defense spending. This is very bullish for defense stocks. Thirdly, if you really like the idea of basically reshoring of US manufacturing and so on and so forth, I think something like a Rockwell or ABB, which are sort of leading providers of automation in manufacturing, I think, are pretty, I think, look pretty good at least on a medium term basis.",

                "title": "China raises tariffs on US goods to 125% as it slams Trump",
                "body": "China will raise its tariffs against the U.S. to 125% from Saturday in the latest escalation in the burgeoning trade war, the finance ministry announced today. The new duties are a significant climb from the 84% announced on Wednesday, rising to meet the current U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese goods.\n\nBeijing said that the U.S. tariffs against China defy 'basic economic laws and common sense' after Donald Trump raised the rate on Chinese imports to 125%. A statement from the finance ministry said the imposition of 'abnormally high tariffs' amounted to 'unilateral bullying and coercion'. China's tariff hike only moves in line with Trump's latest raft of duties; Washington said yesterday the 125% announced Wednesday compounded an existing 20%.\n\nBeijing did say that it would not respond to any more tariffs imposed by the U.S. The Trump administration has kept up the pressure on China despite climbing down from high, and varied, duties on dozens of other trading partners this week. While the EU now faces a baseline 10% rate pending 90 days for negotiations, leaders are still contemplating countermeasures should talks falter. Meeting with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday, Xi Jinping urged cooperation with China to resist what he called 'unilateral bullying' from the U.S.\n\nThe three-month reprieve on hefty tariffs against 57 countries followed 'pressure from China', Beijing said in a show of goodwill. ' China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices,' Xi said on Friday, state news agency Xinhua reported. This, he stressed, would not only 'safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also... safeguard international fairness and justice.' Sanchez, in turn, told a press conference following his meeting with Xi that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between the European Union and China.\n\nSpain buys about 45 billion euros ($49.1 billion) of goods every year from China, its fourth-largest trading partner, but sells around 7.4 billion euros' worth. 'Both Spain and Europe have a significant trade deficit with China that we must work to rectify,' he admitted. But, he said, 'we must not let trade tensions stand in the way of the potential growth of the relationship between China and Spain and between China and the EU'. Sanchez broke with the rest of the European Union on his last trip to China in September 2024, urging the bloc to reconsider plans to impose high tariffs on Chinese electric cars and calling for a 'fair trade order'.\n\nChina has found itself largely isolated in Trump's trade war, heavily penalised with tariffs as the new administration looks to encourage domestic manufacturing. There is no winner in a tariff war, and going against the world will only push the U.S. into self-isolation, President Xi said during his meeting with Sanchez. Beijing has vowed not to shy away from the fight should Trump insist upon his economic conflict with China. But Xi did say any further tariff hikes from the U.S. would be 'ignored' by China. 'Even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy,' he said, per CNBC.\n\nChina's mission to the World Trade Organization did, however, say today that it had filed an additional complaint to the trade body over U.S. tariffs. 'On 10 April, the United States issued the Executive Order, announcing a further increase of the so-called 'reciprocal tariff' on Chinese products. 'China filed a WTO complaint against United States' latest tariff measures,' the statement from China's mission said, citing a ministry of commerce spokesperson.\n\nWith tensions mounting, Elon Musk's Tesla suspended new orders on its Model S and Model X electric cars in China. Musk has tried to maintain cordial ties with Beijing. China represents a huge market for the car manufacturer and extracts precious metals used in its batteries.\n\nIn Shanxi, China, jewelry stores raised large red banners announcing that American customers would face 104 per cent 'service fees' in store. The Zhangji BBQ Beef Offal Restaurant in Wuhan lifted similar banners, local media reports. Meanwhile, China's e-commerce giant JD.com said on Friday it would launch a 200 billion yuan ($27.35 billion) fund to help the country's exporters sell their products domestically over the next year, as a U.S.-China trade war intensifies.\n\nJD.com said in a statement that it would send its employees to Chinese companies involved in foreign trade, directly purchase their 'high-quality products' and set up a special area on its e-commerce platform to sell these products and direct traffic and marketing support to this area. Separately on Friday, supermarket chain Freshippo, owned by JD.com rival Alibaba and known as Hema in Chinese, said it had opened a fast-track path for export companies to explore the domestic market.\n\nThe support programmes for Chinese exporters could help them re-coup some of their losses stemming from reduced sales overseas by quickly starting or increasing domestic sales, although they will face intense competition in a slowing economy. Like JD.com, Freshippo will set up a special zone on its platform where only products from these companies will be sold. It said it will also make it easier for exporters to get on its platform by simplifying registration procedures and would allow these exporters to make use of the company's warehouse network.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

                "body": "Sánchez echoed the concern, urging Washington and Beijing to resume dialogue and calling trade wars \"not good\" for the world. He also stressed the need for a more balanced EU-China relationship, citing the bloc's $300 billion trade deficit with Beijing.\n\nHours after Beijing raised its tariffs on US products to 125% in the latest salvo of its trade dispute with Washington, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the European Union to join China in defending globalisation and opposing \"unilateral acts of bullying,\" in pointed criticism of President Donald Trump's escalating tariff campaign.\n\nXi made the comments during talks with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez in Beijing on Friday, while saying that China views the EU as a vital partner in a multipolar world and encouraging closer coordination to stabilise global trade. Sounding a warning without referencing the US directly, Xi said, \"There are no winners in a tariff war.\"\n\nChina's commerce ministry announced on Friday that it would raise tariffs on all US imports from 84% to 125%, escalating the trade conflict, but also suggesting it may be Beijing's final tariff move in the current round of retaliations.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe ministry said there was now \"no market acceptance\" for US exports at such high tariff levels and warned that China was prepared to \"fight to the end\" if provoked further. \"If the US continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US, China will ignore it,\" the statement read, hinting at alternative countermeasures still under consideration.\n\nThe news rattled global markets on Friday as Asian indices plunged, with Japan's Nikkei falling nearly 5% and Hong Kong stocks headed for their worst week since 2008. Oil prices were also on track for a second week of declines.\n\nSánchez echoed the concern, urging Washington and Beijing to resume dialogue and terming trade wars as \"not good\" for the world. He also stressed the need for a more balanced EU-China relationship, citing the bloc's $300 billion trade deficit with Beijing.\n\nThe comments came as Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods to over 145%, while China retaliated with 125% duties on US imports. In a partial reprieve, Trump suspended some tariffs on other countries, including the EU, for 90 days.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n'No winners in a tariff war'\n\nOn Friday, Xi welcomed Spain's Pedro Sánchez, after also talking to counterparts in Saudi Arabia and South Africa. According to the official Chinese summary of the talks, Xi said \"there will be no winners in a tariff war, and going against the world will isolate oneself\", in an apparent reference to the US.\n\n\"China and the EU should fulfil their international responsibilities, jointly maintain the trend of economic globalisation and the international trade environment, and jointly resist unilateral bullying, not only to safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also to safeguard international fairness and justice, and to safeguard international rules and order,\" the summary said the Chinese president told Sánchez.\n\nSpain said Sánchez told Xi his country favoured a more balanced relationship between the EU and China based on negotiations to resolve differences and cooperation in areas of common interest.\n\nXi plans to travel to south-east Asia, including Vietnam and Cambodia next week, The Guardian reported.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nMacron wrote on X early on Friday that Trump's partial tariff suspension, pausing new rates on various countries that would have risen as high as 50%, \"sends out a signal and leaves the door open for talks. But this pause is a fragile one.\"\n\nHe added: \"This 90-day pause means 90 days of uncertainty for all our businesses, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond.\"\n\nBattered financial markets were given a brief reprieve on Wednesday when Trump decided to pause duties on dozens of countries. However, his escalating trade dispute with China, the world's second-largest economy, has continued to fuel fears of recession and further retaliation.\n\nThe US's S&P 500 index ended 3.5% lower on Thursday and was now down about 15% from its all-time peak in February.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe 'Pause'\n\nWhile Trump suddenly paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs on other countries hours after they came into effect this week, he excluded China from the reprieve, instead increasing duties on Chinese imports as punishment for Beijing's initial move to retaliate.\n\nTrump had imposed tariffs on Chinese goods of 145% since taking office, a White House official said.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump told reporters at the White House he thought the US could make a deal with China, but reiterated his argument that Beijing had \"really taken advantage\" of the US for a long time.\n\n\"I'm sure that we'll be able to get along very well,\" the US president said, referring to Xi. \"In a true sense, he's been a friend of mine for a long period of time, and I think that we'll end up working out something that's very good for both countries.\"\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nXi and Trump are not known to have spoken since before Trump's inauguration. Beijing has said it has no intention of backing down to what it terms as Trump's \"bullying\" with tariffs.\n\n\"We will never sit idly by and watch while the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people are infringed, nor will we sit idly by as international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system are undermined,\" the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said on Thursday.\n\nAs well as retaliatory tariffs, Beijing has restricted imports of Hollywood films, and put 18 US companies on trade restriction lists.\n\nThe commerce ministry said China's door was open to dialogue but this must be based on mutual respect.\n\n-With inputs from PTI and Reuters",

                "title": "Trump tariffs: Will trade war hasten US, China decoupling?",
                "body": "As tit-for-tat tariffs escalate between Washington and Beijing, the cracks between the world's two biggest economies are growing deeper.\n\nThe US-China trade war has reached new heights as Beijing raised its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 125%, hitting back against US President Donald Trump's decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145%.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday made his first public comments on the escalating trade conflict, telling Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Beijing that \"there are no winners in a trade war, and going against the world will only lead to self-isolation.\"\n\nXi also stressed that Beijing is \"not afraid\" and expressed confidence in the nation's ability to overcome the challenges posed by US President Donald Trump's policies.\n\n\"Regardless of how the external environment changes, China will remain confident, stay focused, and concentrate on managing its own affairs well,\" Xi was quoted as saying by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nOn April 2, Trump unveiled sweeping duties on all US trading partners, unleashing an all-out assault on global trade and sending shockwaves throughout the world economy.\n\nThe levies were set to commence on April 9.\n\nBut hours after they came into effect, the US president announced a 90-day tariff pause for over 75 countries that were seeking trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nTrump, however, excluded China from the pause and instead ratcheted up duties on Chinese imports as punishment for Beijing's initial move to retaliate.\n\nAccusing China of showing a \"lack of respect,\" the US leader raised the tariffs to 125%, bringing total duties on Chinese imports to 145%, including a 20% levy previously imposed over Beijing's alleged failure to curb fentanyl exports to the US.\n\nBeijing criticized Trump's actions as \"bullying\" and vowed to fight \"to the end\" with counteractions.\n\nIf Washington continues to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods, \"China will ignore it,\" the nation's Commerce Ministry stated on Friday, pointing out that US goods would then no longer make economic sense for importers.\n\nThe escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and the unwillingness of either side to initiate talks could lead to a breakdown of trade ties between the world's largest economy, the US, and the second-largest economy, China.\n\n\"The US and the PRC (People's Republic of China) right now are trying to see who can impose more pain on the other side,\" Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, told DW.\n\nAlthough China's reliance on the US market for trade has diminished over the years, it remains substantial, with the Asian giant exporting nearly $440 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024.\n\nOn the flip side, China is also a vital export market for American goods, particularly agricultural products like soybeans and pork, as well as high-tech goods.\n\nGiven the deeply intertwined trade relationship between the two countries, the ongoing tariff war has turned into a contest of \"who can outlast the other,\" Chong says.\n\nWhile some remain hopeful that both sides would eventually back down, Chong sees that as \"wishful thinking\" in light of the leadership styles of Trump and Xi.\n\n\"Neither side wants to lose face. Both sides want to talk tough and act tough. So that creates a situation where there's less negotiation, less willingness to compromise, and more potential for escalation,\" he said.\n\nWhether a full decoupling of the two economies will occur depends on how long the tit-for-tat continues and whether both sides keep the escalation bilateral, according to Chong. He noted that some goods are also rerouted through third countries before reaching the US or China.\n\nWang Guo-Chen, an economist specializing in China at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei, argues that the US and China have \"already economically decoupled in practice as Chinese goods have been unable to enter the US market since Trump raised tariffs to 104%.\"\n\nSince the latest round of the trade war began, China has resorted to retaliatory tariffs, export restrictions to the US, and a suspension of American agricultural imports. More recently, Beijing has rolled out additional ways to strike back.\n\nOn April 11, China's National Film Administration announced plans to \"moderately reduce\" the release of Hollywood films in the Chinese market, citing that US films would likely see reduced popularity following the 145% tariff on Chinese imports.\n\nMeanwhile, China's Commerce Ministry pledges to assist \"foreign trade companies facing export challenges by tapping into the vast domestic market\" through trade-in programs and government initiatives.\n\nBut this domestic pivot may bring unintended consequences, especially for foreign businesses operating in China, which could face increased competition from Chinese firms, said Dali Yang, a political scientist and sinologist at the University of Chicago.\n\nBeijing has also sought to diversify its trade channels in recent years, successfully shifting some production to Vietnam, other Southeast Asian nations, and Mexico. But that strategy is now running into new obstacles.\n\n\"Part of the Trump effort is actually to stop or slow those efforts,\" Yang told DW, adding that these alternative markets also have limited capacity to absorb all the Chinese goods once destined for the US.\n\n\"The simple fact is China operates on such a scale that if allowed, China can practically produce for the entire world,\" Yang said, highlighting the overcapacity issue that continues to weigh on China's trade relationships.\n\nMeanwhile, the US remains a more attractive trading partner for most countries. \"Most countries trading with the US run surpluses. In contrast, many of China's trade partners, while benefiting from Chinese goods, typically run deficits.\"\n\n\"Trading with China, therefore, may not always result in significant job creation in those countries, as the imbalance often favors China,\" Yang said.\n\nDespite the global impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs, China finds itself alone in this \"retaliation\" battle, as other Asian leaders, including from Vietnam, Cambodia and India, quickly expressed their willingness to ease tensions with the US, while Japan and South Korea sent officials to engage in discussions.\n\n\"I think a lot of this is due to Beijing's misjudgment of the situation,\" said Wang, adding that China believed everyone would follow them once they took a strong stance. \"But instead of following the step of Beijing, countries rushed to call Trump and arrange negotiations,\" the expert pointed out.\n\nOn the other hand, Beijing's approach also aims to reinforce and respond to rising nationalist sentiment within China, experts say.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, Beijing has long embraced a tough and confrontational \"wolf warrior\" diplomacy, with anti-America sentiment intensifying as bilateral relations grow strained.\n\n\"But there's also a risk that the animosity generated may be difficult to reverse and control,\" Chong noted. \"It creates a situation where China is likely less willing to compromise, especially if that compromise becomes visible.\"",

She began her career as a freelance writer for Digital Spy, where she wrote about all things TV, film and showbiz. Her favourite topics to cover are music, travel and any bizarre pop culture.\n\nChina has issued a defiant statement to US president Donald Trump as the ongoing trade war between the two nations heats up.\n\nIt would appear the both the Chinese and American governments have found themselves locked in an escalating battle to one-up each other in a trade battle which is playing out in front of the entire world.\n\nAs things currently stand, the US has slapped a charge of 145 percent on Chinese imports, while China responded earlier today by upping their tariffs on American goods to 125 percent.\n\nWhere this whole tit-for-tat saga will end is anybody's guess but, judging by the latest statements coming from Chinese officials, it would seem the East Asian nation has no plans in bowing down to Trump's demands.\n\nAn excerpt from a letter written for the South China Morning Post by Huang Jingrui, spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong referred to Trump as a 'tariff-wielding barbarian'.\n\n\"We must solemnly tell the US: a tariff-wielding barbarian who attempts to force countries to call and beg for mercy can never expect that call from China,\" he wrote.\n\n\"If the US is truly sincere about starting a dialogue with China on tariff issues, it should immediately correct its wrong practices and adopt the right attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit.\"\n\nHis comments echo that of the Chinese Commerce Ministry, who gave the following statement on Friday: \"The successive imposition of excessively high tariffs on China by the US has become nothing more than a numbers game, with no real economic significance.\"\n\nMeanwhile Chinese President Xi Jinping has broken his silence for the first time on the matter, stating there are 'no winners' in a trade war.\n\n\"There are no winners in a trade war, and going against the world will only lead to self-isolation,\" he told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday (via CNN).\n\nAccording to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, President Xi added: \"For over 70 years, China's development has relied on self-reliance and hard work -- never on handouts from others, and it is not afraid of any unjust suppression.\n\n\"Regardless of how the external environment changes, China will remain confident, stay focused, and concentrate on managing its own affairs well.\"\n\nAccording to the BBC, America imports around around $440 billion of goods from China, which accounts for 13 percent of US imports alone.",

                "title": "China raises tariffs on US goods to 125% as Xi Jinping warns Donald Trump 'there are no winners in trade war'",
                "body": "China has announce it will impose 125% tariffs on US goods from Saturday in another huge escalation of the trade war between the two superpowers.\n\nAs Beijing hiked its levies on US imports from 84%, in retaliation to Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods of up to 145%, Xi Jinping stressed that 'there are no winners in a trade war\".\n\nBeijing's finance ministry on Friday said the \"abnormally high tariffs\" imposed by the Trump administration \"seriously violates international and economic trade rules, basic economic laws and common sense and is completely unilateral bullying and coercion\".\n\nXi, in his first public remarks on Trump's tariffs, told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez during a meeting in Beijing on Friday that China and the European Union should \"jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying.\"\n\n\"There are no winners in a trade war,\" the Chinese leader told his guest, adding that by acting together, the world's second-largest economy and the 27-strong European trade bloc could help uphold \"the global rules-based order.\"\n\nThe Chinese announcement came hours after Trump admitted \"transition problems\" with his tariff offensive, as some markets fell again amid continued uncertainty over the president's global trade war.\n\nTrump acknowledged his tariffs had posed \"difficulty\" as an intense bond sell-off continued amid tumbling stocks.\n\nHis statement came hours after he announced that tariffs on China would reach 145% for some products due to a pre-existing 20% levy imposed as punishment for imports of the the drug fentanyl into the US.\n\nEven some of his staunchest supporters, including Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, are questioning Trump's tariffs policy.\n\nMeanwhile Sir Keir Starmer has been warned that Britain striking a trade agreement with the United States is unlikely to avoid Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe Prime Minister has been told it would require an \"extraordinary deal\" to improve on the 10% tax on exports to America that the president placed on the UK last week during his \"Liberation Day\" announcement.\n\nDowning Street still hopes a post-Brexit arrangement with the White House can be reached to soften the blow of the baseline levies imposed last Wednesday.\n\nMost countries currently face the same 10% levy as the UK on importing goods to America after Trump temporarily halted the sweeping \"retaliatory\" measures.\n\nBut Kevin Hassett, a senior economic adviser to Trump, claimed any arrangement that would persuade the president to go below 10% would need to be \"extraordinary\".\n\n\"I think everybody expects that the 10% baseline tariff is going to be the baseline,\" he told CNBC.\n\n\"It is going to take some kind of extraordinary deal for the president to go below there.\"\n\nHe revealed Washington was in negotiations with around 20 countries and that two deals were almost closed.\n\nEconomists have estimated that 10 per cent tariffs combined with the impact of a wider global trade disruption could lead to a 0.6% hit to UK GDP.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves, who got some rare good news with the UK economy performing far better in February than City forecasts, has said she will seek to negotiate with the US when she visits the country at the end of April.\n\nSir Keir rejected the suggestion that Trump is not currently taking his calls, saying: \"You have to understand that for the UK and the US we're actually talking all the time.\"",

                "title": "Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures reverse gains after China hits back at Trump's tariffs",
                "body": "US stocks fell before the bell on Friday, abandoning an earlier comeback bid after China struck back at President Trump's trade offensive by hiking its US tariff rate, further stoking fears of direct trade war.\n\nFutures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) were both down 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also dropped 0.4%, as all three gauges reversed course on earlier premarket gains.\n\nChina said Friday it will raise duties on imports of US goods to 125%, compared with the 84% previously planned, effective Saturday. The move is in direct response to President Trump's ballooning \"reciprocal\" tariffs on China, the commerce ministry said, but suggested it will \"ignore\" any retaliatory US hikes in duties.\n\nTrump's fast-moving tariff policy has whiplashed stocks this week, which saw the major US indexes notch historic gains during Wednesday's session but then tank on Thursday.\n\nThat rout came as initial optimism for President Trump's 90-day \"pause\" on most reciprocal tariffs gave way to concern about escalation in his trade war with China. The tumble was spurred by news the White House had actually hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, not the 125% originally suggested.\n\nRead more: Live updates on Trump tariffs fallout\n\nDespite that, the major indexes are positioned for their best week in months, largely on the back of the mid-week surge. That, of course, could all be upended by whatever Friday has to bring to the discussion.\n\nInvestors will get the March reading on the Producer Price Index later in the day, providing another piece of the pre-tariff inflation puzzle. Given the market's all-consuming focus on US trade policy, the wholesale inflation reading could be overshadowed as a catalyst, as with this week's Consumer Price Index print.\n\nFirst quarter earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with results from big banks such as JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Morgan Stanley (MS). Those earnings will be closely studied for any broad signs of consumer fallout amid the tariff turmoil.",

                "body": "The Chinese president wants to show his people that the country can withstand the economic pain from President Donald Trump's tariffs and stand up to what Beijing is calling America's \"bullying,\" according to experts.\n\nTrump's trade war also feeds into the strategy that Xi has been working on for years: become less reliant on the United States.\n\nThis breakdown in trade is \"exactly what Beijing has been preparing for,\" said Jude Blanchette, director of the RAND China Research Center. \"Beijing is not looking for negotiation.\"\n\nThe world's superpowers are engaged in a risky game of chicken, experts told ABC News. The question is who blinks first.\n\nMORE: Trump and team downplay continued market turmoil as 'transition cost'\n\n\"At the moment, Xi seems to be calculating that China can withstand the damage and that ultimately it's the United States who will blink first,\" said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis\n\nXi's view is that countries will want to do business less with the U.S. because of the uncertainty created by tariffs, which will drive them toward China, said Thomas, who added that China has been preparing for this possibility for years by growing trade relations with the rest of the world.\n\nMORE: Trump's tariffs still risk inflation and recession as China trade war looms, experts say\n\n\"Both Washington and Beijing think they hold the stronger hand for different reasons. The Trump administration sees China as export-dependent, so they believe it's significant leverage to get the Chinese to bend,\" Blanchette said. \"On the other hand, Beijing sees the U.S. as increasingly economically weak under Trump and distanced from its allies.\"\n\nMORE: Trump tariffs live updates: Trump acknowledges 'transition problems,' threatens to return to higher tariffs\n\nWhile Trump in his Cabinet meeting on Thursday called Xi a \"friend\" and said he'd love to strike a deal with China, the calculus isn't so simple for Xi. If Xi walks away from the phone call without a deal, he risks losing face.\n\n\"For Xi, there's a huge amount of risk of looking weak in his dealings with the U.S. He risks being humiliated or not having anything to show for his engagement with Trump,\" Thomas said. \"The tariffs will be economically painful, but Xi also sees this as an opportunity to get China into a healthier situation by reducing reliance on the U.S.\"\n\nMORE: China to limit number of American films imported from US amid tariff battle\n\nThere are also other levers China can pull to retaliate. Experts say Beijing could ban more companies from doing business in China and further limit exports of critical materials, such as rare earth minerals.\n\nChina \"hasn't gone anywhere close to the maximum that it could do with its rare earth exports, considering it's such a dominant player in the industry,\" Thomas said.\n\nMORE: US stocks close sharply lower, wiping away some of historic rally a day earlier\n\nChina could \"shut down huge segments of high-tech supply chains\" by banning rare earth minerals, Thomas said, calling it \"a nuclear option that would severely damage not just the American economy but European and Asian economies.\"\n\nBeijing has also said it will restrict Hollywood films in China. While it's not a \"significant\" retaliation, Thomas said that \"it feeds right into Xi Jinping's broader political agenda to reduce foreign influence on Chinese society.\"\n\nBut Scott Kenney, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that Beijing believes Trump has already blinked by pausing the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days.\n\n\"I think the Chinese will read this as weakness from President Trump and they will wait,\" he said.",

                "title": "China May 'Reduce or Ban' U.S. Movies in Retaliation to Trump's Tariffs, and They Just Made the Fifth Highest-Grossing Film of All Time Anyway",
                "body": "The animated Ne Zha 2 is a phenomenon in China, but what does it tell us about Hollywood's relationship with the country? Related reads:People Are Taking Live Chickens Into Screenings of the Minecraft Movie Now as 'CHICKEN JOCKEY!' Meme Gets Out of Hand\n\nA report emerged this week that China, in retaliation to President Trump's international tariff hikes, is considering \"reducing or banning\" U.S. movies as part of its response. This is not a move that Hollywood will take lightly, considering that China is the second-biggest film market in the world after the United States. (Indeed, the nation overtook the U.S./Canada as the biggest market in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid.)\n\nAnd yet, the country has been leaning on Hollywood movies less and less these days. Most notably, the recent Chinese-made animated film Ne Zha 2 has proven to be a huge hit, grossing $2.11 billion to date. For perspective, that number puts Ne Zha 2 above Avengers: Infinity War and Star Wars: The Force Awakens on the All Time Worldwide Box Office Grossers list. Right now it sits just under the number four film on that list, Titanic, which grossed $2.26 billion. Avatar tops that chart at $2.92 billion. The Chinese film is also now the highest-grossing animated film of all time, beating out Inside Out 2's $1.69 billion. (Grosses via Box Office Mojo.)\n\nHollywood has found increased competition in the Chinese market as locally made films have become more prevalent - and popular. As The LA Times puts it, \"China's film industry has become adept at churning out movies with high production values and support from the Chinese Communist Party.\" This means there are less screens in the country for Hollywood's movies. There's also less interest from China to allow American movies into the country.\n\nStill, it's an important market for the Hollywood studios, particularly as theaters continue to struggle in the post-Covid/post-Hollywood strikes/post-\"we'll wait till it comes to streaming\" world. The 2010s were a good time for U.S. movies in China but things peaked around 2019, which happens to be the year Avengers: Endgame was released. Around $632 million of that Marvel epic's $2.79 billion came from China, so about 22.65% of its total gross. Compare that to last summer's Deadpool & Wolverine, which made $59 million in China and $1.33 billion worldwide. That's just 4.43% of the pie.\n\n22.65% of Avengers: Endgame's gross came from China. For Deadpool & Wolverine it was just 4.43%.\n\nAnd yet, 4.43% is better than nothing. A Minecraft Movie had a huge opening last weekend, having grossed $323 million worldwide (to date). Of that, $14 million came from China, which is about 10% of its total international earnings for the period. So again, nothing to sniff at. (It also beat out Ne Zha 2 at the Chinese box office, although that film was in its tenth week of release at that point.)\n\nLet's look at the films which topped the Chinese box office over the past several years. Note that these are \"calendar grosses,\" which is to say box office receipts earned within a given year regardless of release date. This view provides us with a good cross-section of American and Chinese hit films:\n\nIt's clear that while the halcyon days of making $600 million in Avengers money in China alone may be a thing of the past, there's still an appetite and a market for American films in the country. And while the topic of censorship is an entirely different facet of Hollywood's dealings with China, not to mention the studios' willingness to bend over backwards to get their films released in the country (see The Franchise's Chinese tractors being forced into an outer space superhero epic for product placement - a \"multiverse of farming equipment!\"), the studios also need every cent they can get in the current filmgoing environment.\n\nWhether or not China really does decide to \"reduce or ban\" American movies in the near future, it's clearly going to hurt the U.S. more than it's going to hurt China.\n\nRelated reads:The Minecraft Movie Team Had a Private Server They Played On and Jack Black Even Built His Own Mansion",

                "body": "Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the European Union to join Beijing in resisting \"unilateral bullying,\" state media Xinhua reported.\n\nThe Chinese president's remarks come amid economic tensions between China and the United States due to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.\n\nXi made the comments as he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Beijing.\n\n\"China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices,\" Xi said, according to AFP.\n\nAlso Read | What could be China's next step as Donald Trump slaps it with 125% tariffs?\n\nThe Chinese president stressed that this would not only \"safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also... safeguard international fairness and justice.\"\n\nSanchez, in turn, said that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between the European Union and China.\n\n\"Both Spain and Europe have a significant trade deficit with China that we must work to rectify,\" he said, according to AFP. \"...We must not let trade tensions stand in the way of the potential growth of the relationship between China and Spain and between China and the EU.\"\n\nAlso Read | China opens new front in trade war with US with Hollywood import curbs\n\nThis is Sanchez's third visit to China in just over two years.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has ratcheted up a trade war with China after he hiked the tariff on Chinese imports to 145%.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has now raised the tariff on Chinese goods five times.\n\nThe first two hikes of 10% each were met with what analysts described as a measured response from China that left the door open for talks. But after Trump announced an additional 34% duty on Chinese goods last week, along with tariffs on other countries in his \"Liberation Day\", China matched that with a 34% tariff on imports from the US.\n\nAlso Read | Why did Donald Trump raise US tariffs on China to 125% and hit pause elsewhere?\n\nFollowing China's retaliations, Trump then added a 50% tariff on goods from China, saying negotiations were terminated, and bringing the cumulative US. tariff to 104%.\n\nChina again responded by raising the tariff on American products by the same amount, bringing its total rate to 84%. Then Trump upped the American tariff to 125%.\n\nLater, the White House clarified that the tariffs on China also include a 20% levy put into place earlier this year over Beijing's alleged role in fentanyl trafficking.",

On today's show, President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his tariff plan, acknowledging potential \"transition problems\" but believing it will ultimately be \"a beautiful thing\". The US tariffs on China have risen to 145%, triggering a trade war that has affected global financial markets, with the S&P 500 Index sinking more than 6% on Thursday. Trump indicated a willingness to be \"flexible\" on exemptions for companies or countries from the tariff regime, and expressed optimism that China would eventually come to negotiate.

                "title": "US, China's looming woes may deal a far bigger blow to India than Trump tariffs",
                "body": "Trump Tariff Impact: Swaminathan Aiyar warns that a potential slowdown in the US and China poses a greater threat to India than current tariffs. Despite a temporary tariff pause, uncertainty persists due to President Trump's unpredictable trade policies. Aiyar suggests a US recession is likely, impacting China and dragging down the global economy.If the United States and China - the world's two largest economies - are heading into a major slowdown, the impact on India will be far more severe than anything the current tariff war might bring, Swaminathan Aiyar, , economist and consulting editor at ET Now, has warned.\n\n\"If there is going to be a major slowdown in the world's two largest economies - the USA and China - the rest of the world is going to be hit and that will have a much bigger impact on India than any talk about the bilateral tariffs,\" Aiyar told ET Now.\n\nThe comments come amid rising uncertainty in the global economy after Donald Trump's aggressive trade posturing. This week, the US President increased duties on Chinese imports to 145%, even as he paused his planned tariffs on goods from several countries, including India, for 90 days in response to a sharp selloff in US stock markets. Indian exporters welcomed the move, calling it a much-needed break that gives both sides a window to resume negotiations on a bilateral trade deal.\n\nAiyar had earlier said the tariff measures announced on April 2 and what Trump called \"Liberation Day\" should have instead been described as \"Recession Day,\" with concerns that they will disrupt supply chains, hurt economic growth, and push the world economy into turmoil. Aiyar had dismissed Trump's claim that these tariffs would make America a great manufacturing power, calling it \"a disaster\" and arguing that they would cause economic dislocation rather than revival.\n\nAlso Read: Recession, not Liberation Day! Swaminathan Aiyar sees India, US and world GDP slumping for Trump tariff 'insanity\n\nNow, US has unleashed more tariff salvo on China while Trump flip-flopped on dditional tariffs on all other nations and paused the the inceased taxes for 90 days.\n\nWith Donald Trump's trade policies changing frequently, sometimes within hours, economists and investors have struggled to keep up. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for a US recession, but said it still expects the American economy to slow down sharply this year because of the continued uncertainty around government policies.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs makes U-turn on US recession call\n\nAt the same time, JPMorgan Chase has stuck to its more cautious view. The bank said a US recession is still more likely than not, keeping its estimate at a 60% chance. This comes even after Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nIndia's central bank has cut its economic growth forecast for this financial year, pointing to growing uncertainty in global trade after the US announced new tariffs. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also lowered the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6%, saying it was concerned about slowing demand, tighter liquidity, and new global risks.\n\nMoody's Analytics has also trimmed its growth outlook for India. It now expects the economy to grow by 6.1% in 2025, down by 30 basis points from its previous forecast in March, following the latest round of US tariff measures.\n\n\"Although U.S. President Donald Trump has just declared a 90-day freeze on most of the harsh tariffs announced a week ago and applied a 10% blanket tariff in their place, the April baseline represents the economic toll they will have should they eventually go ahead in full,\" Moody's Analytics said in a note.\n\nEconomists at top global banks, including Morgan Stanley and Nomura, had earlier warned that India and Thailand are among the countries most vulnerable to US President Donald Trump's plan to impose reciprocal tariffs on key trading partners.\n\nAlso Read: Trump's latest tariff hike brings additional China rate to 145%\n\nAccording to Aiyar, a full-scale financial meltdown has likely been averted, but the bond market - not diplomacy - is what forced Trump to hold back.\n\n\"Financial meltdown has been averted because the bond market made it impossible for Trump to continue,\" he said. \"But there are overwhelming chances that there is going to be a US recession.\"\n\nHe also predicted that China, though it may not report negative GDP growth, is bound to experience a major slowdown as a result of the tariffs, with effects similar to a recession.\n\n\"China, with this particular hit, is going to feel the effect of virtually a recession even if it does not actually become negative in terms of GDP growth,\" Aiyar said.\n\nBoth countries being pulled down simultaneously, he warned, will drag down the global economy.\n\nAiyar cautioned that the uncertainty around Trump's next move has now become part of the global economic equation and will continue to influence investor behaviour.\n\n\"There is the complete uncertainty of never knowing what Mr Trump is going to do next week or the next day or even the next hour,\" he said. \"This uncertainty is getting baked into everything else means that everyone will just say, go for safety.\"\n\nIn this context, he expects equities to struggle.\n\n\"I certainly would not expect stocks to do very well in this particular period,\" he said.\n\nDespite the pause, Aiyar made it clear that the trade war has already started and the global economy is at risk.\n\n\"If you have these high 25% on so many items, 10% on so many items, 145% on China, please let us be clear, a trade war has begun,\" he said.\n\nHe said it was still unclear how deep the impact would be or how long it might last, but the outlook was bleak.\n\n\"We are not sure how long, we are not sure how deep it is going to hit world GDP, but it is a dark outlook,\" he said. \"It is not a happy situation, even if it is not as bad as a meltdown.\"\n\nAsked whether India could benefit as manufacturers diversify away from China, Aiyar offered a cautious assessment.\n\n\"Some crumbs may fall into our table,\" he said. While India might gain some incremental production in areas such as textiles or low-end manufacturing, it would not be enough to offset the wider impact of a global slowdown.\n\n\"China has a huge fantastic manufacturing power for the whole world. It has been the factory of the world now for some years,\" he said. \"India may pick up a little bit here and a little bit there, but I regret to say it will be more than offset by two things - the global slowdown that is coming and Mr Trump's wanting to see everybody shrink their trade deficit with the USA.\"\n\nAlso Read: As Trump alienates allies with US tariffs, China is poised to exploit the gaps\n\nIndia, though not the worst-hit country, will still face trouble, Aiyar said, pointing out that key exports such as steel, aluminium, and pharmaceuticals remain vulnerable to 25% tariffs.\n\n\"India is a significant exporter of things like steel, aluminium, cars not so much to the USA. Pharmaceutical, yes. All of these are open to a 25% tariff,\" he said.\n\nThe country might benefit slightly in textiles and some niche sectors, but the broader damage from a global economic contraction would outweigh those benefits.\n\n\"Overall, we are definitely going to be losers with these high tariffs on so many important things,\" he said. \"But all of this will go into the shade compared with the slowdown being imposed on the world by the huge fall in the two largest economies in the world.\"\n\nAlso Read: Trump's tariff bombshell hits India, but some desi sectors dodge the shrapnel\n\nAiyar drew parallels between Trump's recent moves and the short-lived fiscal strategy of former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose spending plans triggered chaos in UK gilt markets and led to her downfall.\n\n\"Something similar has followed in the US,\" he said. He explained that global investors were spooked by the idea that even US treasuries - traditionally seen as the world's safest asset - could lose value.\n\n\"When even the safest of all things, US gilts, began to fall, they said, my God, we are now in for a financial meltdown,\" he said. \"This is something much worse than a recession where the most fundamental building block of the entire bond system is failing.\"\n\nHe said the sheer size and significance of the bond market - much larger than equities - meant the threat of a US default or crisis in treasuries could not be ignored.\n\n\"The bond markets are much bigger than equity markets. And the fundamental building block of the global bond market is the US gilt. If that was going to go, the uncertainty and the possibilities of meltdown were enormous,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead, Aiyar said the trade war will remain a central risk for the global economy for the next two years, even if another meltdown is avoided.\n\n\"Remember that the trade wars are not over. There is a saying of Winston Churchill: 'This is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end, it is just the end of the beginning.' I would say that is where we are in the trade wars,\" he said.\n\nHe believes Trump will continue to impose tariffs as a political and economic strategy, aiming to fulfil his promises of bringing back manufacturing to the US.\n\n\"Do not expect Mr Trump to give up on his great idea of putting up tariffs in order to attract investment back to the USA. He has promised to his people one way or the other, and he will try to deliver,\" he said.\n\nWhile the markets may now act as a check on extreme measures, Aiyar warned that volatility and economic damage could still result from less dramatic moves.\n\n\"He will not do anything as dramatic as to cause a financial meltdown, that we have learned. But anything short of that, he will keep trying from time to time,\" he said.",

                "title": "Facing Trump tariffs, Vietnam eyes crackdown on some China trade",
                "body": "In hope of avoiding punishing U.S. tariffs, Vietnam is prepared to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped to the United States via its territory and will tighten controls on sensitive exports to China, according to a person familiar with the matter and a government document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe offer, the details of which are reported by Reuters for the first time, came as senior U.S. officials, including the influential White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, raised concerns about Chinese goods being sent to America with \"Made in Vietnam\" labels that draw lower duties.\n\nVietnam has for weeks been offering sweeteners that it hoped would persuade the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to take a benign view of its huge trade surplus with America. Instead, it was hit with a 46% tariff as part of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" salvo.\n\nWhile the tariff has been suspended for 90 days, the two countries agreed to start talks after a Vietnamese deputy prime minister met with the U.S. Trade Representative on Wednesday.\n\nExport-reliant Vietnam is hoping to get the duties reduced to a range of 22% to 28%, if not lower, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nOne of them said that U.S. officials had signalled that range was likely, during a bilateral meeting in March.\n\nVietnam's trade ministry and the USTR's office did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn announcing the start of trade talks with the U.S. on Thursday, Vietnam's government said on its official portal it would crack down on \"trade fraud.\" It did not provide specifics.\n\nSince Trump's first term, many multi-national firms have implemented a \"China plus one\" policy of setting up factories in Vietnam to reduce exposure to Beijing.\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation is in a tight spot as it tries to preserve trade with the U.S., which is its largest export market and a security partner. At the same time, Hanoi does not want to antagonize China, which is a top source of investment as well as a neighbour with which it has clashed over boundaries in the South China Sea.\n\nVietnam's Government Office, a body that coordinates between its ministries, held an emergency meeting with government trade experts on April 3, hours after Trump announced the tariffs.

While the tariff has been suspended for 90 days, the two countries agreed to start talks after a Vietnamese deputy prime minister met with the U.S. Trade Representative on Wednesday.\n\nExport-reliant Vietnam is hoping to get the duties reduced to a range of 22% to 28%, if not lower, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nOne of them said that U.S. officials had signalled that range was likely, during a bilateral meeting in March. Vietnam's trade ministry and the USTR's office did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn announcing the start of trade talks with the U.S. on Thursday, Vietnam's government said on its official portal it would crack down on \"trade fraud.\" It did not provide specifics. Since Trump's first term, many multi-national firms have implemented a \"China plus one\" policy of setting up factories in Vietnam to reduce exposure to Beijing.\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation is in a tight spot as it tries to preserve trade with the U.S., which is its largest export market and a security partner. At the same time, Hanoi does not want to antagonize China, which is a top source of investment as well as a neighbour with which it has clashed over boundaries in the South China Sea.\n\nVietnam's Government Office, a body that coordinates between its ministries, held an emergency meeting with government trade experts on April 3, hours after Trump announced the tariffs. The aim was to address Washington's concerns over alleged intellectual property theft and transhipment abuses, according to a person briefed on the meeting.\n\nAt the meeting, trade ministry and customs officials were told to tighten controls and were given two weeks to devise a plan to clamp down on illicit transhipment. The deadline could be extended until late April, the person said, adding that Hanoi wanted to be careful not to provoke China.\n\nIllicit transhipment refers to one country sending goods to a nation facing lower tariffs from a third country, to which the product is re-exported without having value added to it. Vietnam's Government Office and the customs department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany of the goods exported by Vietnam to the West have Chinese-made inputs, and Chinese companies have also established factories in the country to serve U.S. customers.\n\nIn many instances, Vietnamese workers process the goods, which are then legally shipped to the U.S. under a \"Made in Vietnam\" label. Official trade data show Vietnam's exports to the U.S. in recent years have been fuelled by imports from China, with inflows from Beijing closely matching the value and swings of exports to Washington.\n\nU.S. officials have alleged, however, that China uses Vietnam as a conduit to obtain lower tariffs for goods that do not have significant Vietnamese involvement.\n\n\"China uses Vietnam to tranship to avoid the tariffs,\" Navarro said on Fox News on April 6, without providing evidence. A person familiar with the matter said that in some instances, ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwelled in Vietnamese ports just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving. Reuters could not immediately establish if Vietnam's offer was enough to address U.S. concerns over abuse of transhipment or if the country could comprehensively tackle the problem. A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said in response to Reuters' question that trade between Beijing and Hanoi \"is essentially a win-win situation. We believe that Vietnam will make a choice that is in line with its own long-term interests and the overall situation of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Vietnam.\"\n\nCHIPS, SATELLITES AND PLANES\n\nVietnam is also implementing tougher measures on sensitive goods that flow through its territory from the U.S. to China.\n\nHanoi intends to tighten controls around the export of dual-use goods like semiconductors, which can be used for both civilian and military purposes, according to a draft decree reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe decree, which states it was prepared at the request of the trade ministry, was not dated but it includes an explanatory note dated April 4.\n\nThe document said that major trading partners had requested that Hanoi \"minimize the possibility of these source technologies being transferred to third countries without the consent of the exporting country.\"\n\nThe U.S. government considers leadership on artificial intelligence as a national priority and Washington has moved to cut off China's access to the most advanced U.S.-made chips.\n\nVietnam now plans to introduce new declaration and approval procedures for the trade of such products, according to the proposal.\n\nHanoi previously said that it discussed controls over exports of dual-use goods with U.S. officials during meetings in March. Other tech-related gestures directed at the U.S. include Hanoi's approval, under favourable conditions, for the Starlink satellite communication service controlled by Trump's billionaire ally Elon Musk. Musk appeared to confirm Starlink's ambitions in the country when he reposted on April 4 the contents of an earlier Reuters article that detailed the company's plans for the deployment of multiple ground stations. Musk's primacy in space is seen as a threat by Beijing, which is rushing to launch satellites into lower-earth orbit. Vietnam, a medium-sized country whose diplomats have a long history of juggling ties with great powers, will host Chinese leader Xi Jinping next week. Xi's trip is likely to coincide with Vietnam's aviation regulator approving China's COMAC planes, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThat could open the way for the leasing and purchase by Vietnamese airlines of the Chinese jets, which have so far struggled to find foreign buyers. The approval would follow this week's announcements by Vietnamese airlines of agreements on U.S. loans for the purchase of Boeing planes.",

                "body": "HANOI (Reuters) - In hope of avoiding punishing U.S. tariffs, Vietnam is prepared to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped to the United States via its territory and will tighten controls on sensitive exports to China, according to a person familiar with the matter and a government document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe offer, the details of which are reported by Reuters for the first time, came as senior U.S. officials, including the influential White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, raised concerns about Chinese goods being sent to America with \"Made in Vietnam\" labels that draw lower duties.\n\nVietnam has for weeks been offering sweeteners that it hoped would persuade the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to take a benign view of its huge trade surplus with America. Instead, it was hit with a 46% tariff as part of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" salvo.\n\nWhile the tariff has been suspended for 90 days, the two countries agreed to start talks after a Vietnamese deputy prime minister met with the U.S. Trade Representative on Wednesday.\n\nExport-reliant Vietnam is hoping to get the duties reduced to a range of 22% to 28%, if not lower, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nOne of them said that U.S. officials had signalled that range was likely, during a bilateral meeting in March.\n\nVietnam's trade ministry and the USTR's office did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn announcing the start of trade talks with the U.S. on Thursday, Vietnam's government said on its official portal it would crack down on \"trade fraud.\" It did not provide specifics.\n\nSince Trump's first term, many multi-national firms have implemented a \"China plus one\" policy of setting up factories in Vietnam to reduce exposure to Beijing.\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation is in a tight spot as it tries to preserve trade with the U.S., which is its largest export market and a security partner. At the same time, Hanoi does not want to antagonize China, which is a top source of investment as well as a neighbour with which it has clashed over boundaries in the South China Sea.\n\nVietnam's Government Office, a body that coordinates between its ministries, held an emergency meeting with government trade experts on April 3, hours after Trump announced the tariffs.

                "body": "China's film authorities are threatening to \"moderately reduce\" the number of U.S. films allowed into the country in response to the tariffs President Trump imposed on the communist nation.\n\n\"The wrong action of the U.S. government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favorability towards American films,\" the China Film Administration said in a statement on Thursday. \"We will follow the market rules, respect the audience's choice and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.\"\n\nChina's film authority did not release a list of the films on the ban list, but the May release of Marvel's Thunderbols has already been approved fore release in China.\n\n\"We are pleased that China Film Administration has clarified its position on U.S. film imports and highly confident -- given our decades of business and strong relationships in the country -- that Imax's robust slate in China, which includes Hollywood, Chinese and international films, will not be materially impacted. We continue to expect a strong year for Imax in China, coming off our highest grossing first quarter ever in the country,\" Imax said in a statement.\n\nTrump paused his threatened tariffs on 75 countries on Wednesday, but China was not one of them, The Wrap noted.\n\n\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Trump said. \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\"\n\nStill, Hollywood has been reducing its reliance on the second biggest film market in world as U.S. films have seen falling income levels as Chinese fans have turned away from American entertainment. Last year, for instance, U.S. films brought in $585 million in China last year. But that haul was only about 3.5 percent of the $17.71 billion Chinese box office, The Verge reported.\n\nThat isn't to say that U.S. films aren't making cash in China.",

                "body": "Donald Trump's trade war with China, marked by escalating tariffs, has strained relationships with key U.S. allies. While Trump prioritizes \"America First,\" China is positioning itself as a champion of open markets and global stability, potentially gaining influence amid U.S. isolationism. Despite some nations expressing concerns about U.S. tariffs, building a unified front against them remains a challenge.As US President Donald Trump tries to turn his global trade war into a one-on-one showdown with China, he is finding that he has alienated some key U.S. partners who could boost America's position in a fight between the world's largest and second-largest economies.\n\nFor more than a decade, American leaders, including Trump, have tried to reorient U.S. economic policy, security strategy and alliances to confront China's rise. Yet nearly three months into his second term, Trump's \"America First\" tariffs and budget cutbacks may have provided Beijing its clearest opening yet to escape years of U.S. pressure.\n\nAlso Read: Trump-Xi potential showdown on cards as US targets China alone in tariff war\n\nThis week, Trump doubled down on China, raising duties on its imports to a staggering 145%, even as he eased off his planned tariffs on much of the world's goods for 90 days in the face of a stock market meltdown. But the whipsaw of economic threats on American allies and partners has already taken a toll, beyond just upending global trade.\n\nAs Trump preaches protectionism, China is sending a starkly different message: Its markets will only open wider, and the world can count on China for much-desired stability.\n\nIn its own fight for survival, Beijing - the primary target of Trump's tariff wrath - is jostling for a position in the global trade reshuffle to pounce at the U.S. isolationism, exploit its lapses and gain greater influences.\n\n\"The world must embrace fairness and reject hegemonism,\" the Chinese government has declared, in a clear reference to the U.S. It's an apparent call for unity from countries facing high tariffs from the U.S., as its leaders have held talks with their counterparts from the European Union, South Korea, Japan and more.\n\n\"As the second largest economy and second largest market for consumer goods, China is committed to opening even wider to the world, no matter how the international situation changes,\" the Chinese government said in a position statement on U.S. tariffs.\n\nUS moves cause multiple counter reactions The blow the Trump administration has dealt to the rest of the world with his tariff agenda has come after he pulled the U.S. from international groups such as the World Health Organization, dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and gutted the U.S. Agency for Global Media, raising worries that the U.S. is losing friends and ceding influences to China on several fronts.\n\n\"We should be forging stronger coalitions to compete with China. But instead, the Trump Administration is keen on turning our back on the very partnerships that have helped keep the U.S. strong and secure for generations,\" Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said shortly after Trump unveiled his tariff plan last week.\n\nBut the game also is shifting for Beijing, as evidenced by Trump's announcing a tariff pause for all nations but China.\n\n\"You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China, when, in fact, we've seen the opposite effect. The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China, because they need our markets,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said after Trump's announcement.\n\nYet Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the administration is not interested in coalition-building, which was a hallmark of the Biden administration's efforts to counter China and extend the U.S agenda abroad.\n\n\"The answer is, the president is focused on America,\" Lutnick told reporters. \"He's going to try to negotiate the best deals for America with each of these great countries that are calling us that want to talk. So he's not trying to build a coalition or any kind of thing like that.\"\n\nAn opportunity for Beijing? Trump's drastic tariff plans have prompted countries to explore new approaches. Beijing has been presented with an opportunity but is not taking advantage of it, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center,\n\n\"With China hitting back the U.S. so hard by their own retaliatory tariffs, and both countries escalating into a trade war between the world's two largest economies, I think they're both focused on each other and not focused on the other countries around the world,\" he said, adding China's manufacturing overcapacity would be a challenge to any other market.\n\nGabriel Wildau, a managing director at the consultancy Teneo, observed in a note that Trump's tariff suspension \"appears to be at least partially an effort to isolate China\" and that China now \"faces diminished prospects of assembling a broad international coalition to resist US tariffs by forging new trade blocs that exclude the U.S.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, House Democrats said Trump tariffs - which have since been paused - hurt ties with critical Pacific allies and partners, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and Vietnam, by pushing them away from the United States but closer to China.\n\n\"We have launched a trade war against every single one of our partners in the Asia region,\" said the panel's ranking democrat, Rep. Adam Smith, of Washington. And from Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn.: \"This is driving our allies in the wrong direction.\"\n\nNot quite, said Mississippi Rep. Trent Kelly who defended the tariffs. \"Being taken advantage of is not how we become strong leaders,\" the Republican said.\n\nShortly after Trump announced the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on April 2, Krishnamoorthi called the move \"a complete capitulation of American global leadership that will only benefit the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\nChina navigates the new landscape As the tariff war with the U.S. intensified, Chinese Premier Li Qiang had a phone conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. China, said Li, was \"ready to work with the European side to promote the sound and steady development of China-EU relations.\" Li said the two are each other's \"most important trading partners\", their economies are \"highly complementary\" and their interests \"closely intertwined.\"\n\nVon der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China to support a strong reformed trading system \"in response to the widespread disruption caused by the U.S. tariffs\". But she also told Li that European businesses need better access to the Chinese market.\n\nChinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, in a video call Thursday, told the trade chief of Malaysia that China was ready to work with trading partners and to resolve respective concerns \"in a joint effort to safeguard the multilateral trading system.\" Malaysia holds the rotating chair of ASEAN, the regional grouping of 10 Southeast Asian nations.\n\nThat same day, the economic ministers of ASEAN countries, in a joint statement, expressed concerns over the unilateral tariffs. \"This has caused uncertainty and will bring significant challenges to businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises as well as to global trade dynamics,\" the statement said.\n\nIn late March, Wang also met his counterparts from Japan and South Korea before they issued a statement recognizing the need for cooperation to address \"emerging challenges\" and pledging to enhance cooperation on supply chains.\n\nBut in a sign of the group's limitations, the meeting produced no agreement on what to do about U.S. tariffs.",

Yet nearly three months into his second term, Trump's \"America First\" tariffs and budget cutbacks may have provided Beijing its clearest opening yet to escape years of U.S. pressure.\n\nThis week, Trump doubled down on China, raising duties on its imports to a staggering 145%, even as he eased off his planned tariffs on much of the world's goods for 90 days in the face of a stock market meltdown. But the whipsaw of economic threats on American allies and partners has already taken a toll, beyond just upending global trade.\n\nAs Trump preaches protectionism, China is sending a starkly different message: Its markets will only open wider, and the world can count on China for much-desired stability.\n\nIn its own fight for survival, Beijing - the primary target of Trump's tariff wrath - is jostling for a position in the global trade reshuffle to pounce at the U.S. isolationism, exploit its lapses and gain greater influences.\n\n\"The world must embrace fairness and reject hegemonism,\" the Chinese government has declared, in a clear reference to the U.S. It's an apparent call for unity from countries facing high tariffs from the U.S., as its leaders have held talks with their counterparts from the European Union, South Korea, Japan and more.\n\nU.S. flag themed wearables are displayed at the Yiwu International Trade Market in Yiwu, eastern China's Zhejiang province, Thursday, April 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\n\"As the second largest economy and second largest market for consumer goods, China is committed to opening even wider to the world, no matter how the international situation changes,\" the Chinese government said in a position statement on U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe blow the Trump administration has dealt to the rest of the world with his tariff agenda has come after he pulled the U.S. from international groups such as the World Health Organization, dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and gutted the U.S. Agency for Global Media, raising worries that the U.S. is losing friends and ceding influences to China on several fronts.\n\n\"We should be forging stronger coalitions to compete with China. But instead, the Trump Administration is keen on turning our back on the very partnerships that have helped keep the U.S. strong and secure for generations,\" Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said shortly after Trump unveiled his tariff plan last week.\n\nBut the game also is shifting for Beijing, as evidenced by Trump's announcing a tariff pause for all nations but China.\n\n\"You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China, when, in fact, we´ve seen the opposite effect. The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China, because they need our markets,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said after Trump's announcement.\n\nYet Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the administration is not interested in coalition-building, which was a hallmark of the Biden administration's efforts to counter China and extend the U.S agenda abroad.\n\n\"The answer is, the president is focused on America,\" Lutnick told reporters. \"He´s going to try to negotiate the best deals for America with each of these great countries that are calling us that want to talk. So he´s not trying to build a coalition or any kind of thing like that.\"\n\nTrump's drastic tariff plans have prompted countries to explore new approaches. Beijing has been presented with an opportunity but is not taking advantage of it, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council´s GeoEconomics Center,\n\n\"With China hitting back the U.S. so hard by their own retaliatory tariffs, and both countries escalating into a trade war between the world's two largest economies, I think they're both focused on each other and not focused on the other countries around the world,\" he said, adding China's manufacturing overcapacity would be a challenge to any other market.\n\nGabriel Wildau, a managing director at the consultancy Teneo, observed in a note that Trump's tariff suspension \"appears to be at least partially an effort to isolate China\" and that China now \"faces diminished prospects of assembling a broad international coalition to resist US tariffs by forging new trade blocs that exclude the U.S.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, House Democrats said Trump tariffs - which have since been paused - hurt ties with critical Pacific allies and partners, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and Vietnam, by pushing them away from the United States but closer to China.\n\n\"We have launched a trade war against every single one of our partners in the Asia region,\" said the panel´s ranking democrat, Rep. Adam Smith, of Washington. And from Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn.: \"This is driving our allies in the wrong direction.\"\n\nNot quite, said Mississippi Rep. Trent Kelly who defended the tariffs. \"Being taken advantage of is not how we become strong leaders,\" the Republican said.\n\nShortly after Trump announced the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on April 2, Krishnamoorthi called the move \"a complete capitulation of American global leadership that will only benefit the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\nAs the tariff war with the U.S. intensified, Chinese Premier Li Qiang had a phone conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. China, said Li, was \"ready to work with the European side to promote the sound and steady development of China-EU relations.\" Li said the two are each other's \"most important trading partners\", their economies are \"highly complementary\" and their interests \"closely intertwined.\"\n\nVon der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China to support a strong reformed trading system \"in response to the widespread disruption caused by the U.S. tariffs\". But she also told Li that European businesses need better access to the Chinese market.\n\nChinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, in a video call Thursday, told the trade chief of Malaysia that China was ready to work with trading partners and to resolve respective concerns \"in a joint effort to safeguard the multilateral trading system.\" Malaysia holds the rotating chair of ASEAN, the regional grouping of 10 Southeast Asian nations.\n\nThat same day, the economic ministers of ASEAN countries, in a joint statement, expressed concerns over the unilateral tariffs. \"This has caused uncertainty and will bring significant challenges to businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises as well as to global trade dynamics,\" the statement said.\n\nIn late March, Wang also met his counterparts from Japan and South Korea before they issued a statement recognizing the need for cooperation to address \"emerging challenges\" and pledging to enhance cooperation on supply chains.\n\nBut in a sign of the group's limitations, the meeting produced no agreement on what to do about U.S. tariffs.\n\nAssociated Press writer Lolita C.

Adam Smith, of Washington. And from Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn.: \"This is driving our allies in the wrong direction.\"\n\nNot quite, said Mississippi Rep. Trent Kelly who defended the tariffs. \"Being taken advantage of is not how we become strong leaders,\" the Republican said.\n\nShortly after Trump announced the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on April 2, Krishnamoorthi called the move \"a complete capitulation of American global leadership that will only benefit the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\nChina navigates the new landscape\n\nAs the tariff war with the U.S. intensified, Chinese Premier Li Qiang had a phone conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. China, said Li, was \"ready to work with the European side to promote the sound and steady development of China-EU relations.\" Li said the two are each other's \"most important trading partners\", their economies are \"highly complementary\" and their interests \"closely intertwined.\"\n\nVon der Leyen stressed the responsibility of Europe and China to support a strong reformed trading system \"in response to the widespread disruption caused by the U.S. tariffs\". But she also told Li that European businesses need better access to the Chinese market.\n\nChinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, in a video call Thursday, told the trade chief of Malaysia that China was ready to work with trading partners and to resolve respective concerns \"in a joint effort to safeguard the multilateral trading system.\" Malaysia holds the rotating chair of ASEAN, the regional grouping of 10 Southeast Asian nations.\n\nThat same day, the economic ministers of ASEAN countries, in a joint statement, expressed concerns over the unilateral tariffs. \"This has caused uncertainty and will bring significant challenges to businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises as well as to global trade dynamics,\" the statement said.\n\nIn late March, Wang also met his counterparts from Japan and South Korea before they issued a statement recognizing the need for cooperation to address \"emerging challenges\" and pledging to enhance cooperation on supply chains.\n\nBut in a sign of the group's limitations, the meeting produced no agreement on what to do about U.S. tariffs.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lolita C.

But China now faces a 145% tariff because of \"the lack of respect that China has shown,\" Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nForrester retail industry analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance that consumer pushback in other regions will likely be limited in impact, but China remains the big question mark.\n\n\"It's less like Europe or Canada,\" she said. \"I do think [China is] a permanent rupture that I'm not sure is going to be fixed anytime soon ... I don't know the future of American companies in China,\" she said. The country has instituted an 84% tariff on American goods in response.\n\nUS brands have already been struggling in China amid aggressive local competition and flagging domestic economy.\n\nAs of the latest quarter, Nike sold $1.73 billion of goods in Greater China, a 17% drop from the previous year. It sold $4.86 billion in North America.\n\n\"Nike is in a really, really tough spot. They're in a turnaround for a whole host of reasons.

Localized product and innovation are cutting through this tough backdrop but aren't enough to offset the pressure.\"\n\nSkechers reported $333.5 million of revenue in China last quarter, down 11% year over year.\n\nSkechers CFO John Vandemore told investors \"China was the drag\" on its international business.\n\n\"China continues to be the challenge that, in its size and scale, gives it a disproportionate impact, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.\" Vandemore said the team is \"working very diligently to address what they can in the market.\"\n\nThe company plans to stay the course, saying its business \"ultimately will be a very good fit with that market.\"\n\nTapestry reported growth in its Greater China business last quarter. Its revenue of $272.8 million is up 3% compared to last year.\n\n\"We delivered low-single-digit growth in the quarter, significantly outpacing the industry,\" CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told Yahoo Finance, citing that innovation and value led shoppers to the brand.\n\nWhile it might have been a slight uptick, CFRA analyst Zach Warring said in a note, \"We now see very little upside potential in China as one of the world's largest economies continues to struggle.\" The country makes up 15% of Tapestry's total sales, compared to North America's 65%.\n\nRalph Lauren recently saw its China revenue grow 20% year over year, driven by same-store sales growth, new customers, and \"key marketing moments,\" CFO Justin Picicci told investors.\n\nAs these retailers look to hold down their business in China, they also face a changing consumer environment in the US and an ever-changing backdrop of how much these tariffs actually are.\n\n\"Companies are hesitant to take price really quickly ... I haven't seen any brand take price yet, and I think it's because they don't want to walk back,\" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia told Yahoo Finance.\n\nTariffs have already caused US consumers to be more pessimistic about the economy, which could prompt them to pull back on spending. According to the Conference Board's consumer confidence index out in late March, US consumers' expectations about the economy dropped to a 12-year low.\n\nPwC US consumer markets adviser Ali Furman told Yahoo Finance last week, \"Lower-end consumers who are already under a lot of pressure, they're probably getting more anxious and even more cost-conscious, because they're afraid that prices are going to go up and they're already struggling to afford necessities.\"\n\n\"Forget about discretionary,\" she added, as average consumers become more discerning, making choices between purchasing apparel, consumer electronics, home decor, or dining out.\n\n--\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                "title": "Trump tariffs mean higher prices and big losses for Amazon sellers that source from China",
                "body": "Trump tariffs mean higher prices and big losses for Amazon sellers that source from China\n\nKatie Tarasov, CNBC\n\nApril 10, 2025 at 11:13 PM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy on April 2 didn't just cause mayhem in the stock market. It sent Amazon sellers into a panic.\n\nMany sellers on Amazon count on China for manufacturing and assembly due to lower costs and established infrastructure -- up to 70% of goods on Amazon come from China, according to Wedbush Securities. With nearly all imports from China being taxed a staggering 145% under the latest tariffs, Amazon sellers are having to decide whether to raise prices or absorb the vastly increased cost of importing their goods.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday told CNBC that its vast network of third-party sellers will likely \"pass the cost on\" to consumers. He added that Amazon has done some \"strategic forward inventory buys\" and looked to renegotiate terms on some purchase orders to keep prices low.\n\nAlthough Trump temporarily lowered tariffs on most countries to 10% on Wednesday, he doubled down on the huge tariffs on goods from China. Before the pause, average tariff rates under Trump were at the highest level since the Great Depression. The \"reciprocal tariffs\" were far steeper in regions like Southeast Asia. Tariffs also hit U.S. allies at unusual rates, including 20% on the European Union and previously announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\n\nJosianne Boisvert of Canadian-based Portable Winch Co. said she \"was in a state of shock\" when the tariffs were announced. For 20 years, the company has driven its products an hour to the U.S. border for duty-free shipping to American customers.\n\n\"We are questioning ourselves if we just move our focus to Europe,\" Boisvert said.\n\nCNBC talked to several Amazon sellers to find out how the new tariffs are having an impact on their decisions about prices and where to manufacture.\n\nPrice hikes\n\nIn a small warehouse in San Rafael, California, Dusty Kenney showed CNBC hundreds of boxes filled with her PrimaStella brand baby spoons, bento boxes and other kids products. Most of them arrived by sea from China before tariffs went into effect. Paying the added tariffs could put her out of business if they continue, she said.\n\n\"I will hold my prices for as long as I can and just absorb those tariffs because I'm already competing against those Chinese sellers that are undercutting me,\" Kenney said. Although tariffs will also impact her Chinese-based competitors, the cost of doing business in the U.S. is far higher than in China.\n\nMore from CNBC\n\nTrump's triple-digit tariff essentially cuts off most trade with China, says economist\n\nSee if you qualify for the $1,400 IRS stimulus check before the deadline\n\nDow tumbles 1,000 points, wiping out a chunk of Wednesday's historic rally: Live updates\n\n\"The administration would like people to think that this is a China problem, and that this is only hurting Chinese-based businesses and helping U.S.-based businesses. But I am a U.S.-based business, let's be clear,\" Kenney said. \"Everything's warehoused here, designed here, photographed here. All the income that comes from that stays here.\"\n\nSeveral sellers said they are considering raising prices if Trump's tariffs stick around.\n\nThe vast majority of products on Amazon are sold by third-parties, but tariffs will also impact the company's first-party brands.\n\nThat includes Amazon Basics-branded batteries, which compete against the likes of Duracell and Energizer by retailing at lower prices, said Jason Goldberg of the Publicis Groupe.\n\nIf Amazon has to raise the price of its own batteries, he said, \"consumers are likely to have a preference for that well-known, familiar brand.\"\n\nThe Seattle-based tech company is likely to wait at least six months before passing the tariff costs on to consumers, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.\n\n\"The last thing they want to do is right away just pass it to the consumer, because you don't know how transitory this is,\" said Ives, adding that Amazon likely got \"well ahead of this\" by diversifying its supply chain outside of China.\n\nThat's a strategy many Amazon sellers are also trying.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nReviving U.S. manufacturing?\n\nSome categories, like toys, have a long history of being manufactured in China and have thus far been exempt from tariffs. Jay Foreman started his career at a toy factory in Brooklyn, New York, about 40 years ago.\n\nManufacturing migrated to China more than 30 years ago because of, \"not only a tremendous workforce, but they've invested in the infrastructure to create a toy manufacturing supply chain,\" said Foreman, CEO of Basic Fun, which makes popular toys like Tonka Trucks, Care Bears, Lincoln Logs, Tinker Toys, and Lite-Brite.\n\n\"Whether you're making a Tonka Truck in China or an Apple iPhone, they figured it out. They're making quality product there and it's tough to replicate elsewhere,\" Foreman said.\n\nA lot of toy manufacturing moved to Vietnam, Mexico and India in the last five years because of China tariffs during Trump's first term, Foreman said. But many of the toy factories there are also owned by Chinese companies, he said.\n\n\"So you're sort of not escaping doing business with the Chinese,\" Foreman said.\n\nOther product categories, like teas, can't easily be grown in the U.S. because of the climate.\n\n\"You need high humidity. Usually you need to be at a very high altitude. And those things only come together in certain parts of the world, \" said James Fayal, who runs high-energy tea brand Zest. With its green tea grown in coastal China and black tea in India, Fayal said he'll have to pass the cost on to consumers because he doesn't have a U.S. option.\n\nFor the brands that do manufacture in the U.S., the tariffs are creating a competitive advantage, those companies said.\n\n\"Put our products side by side to a competitor's that is getting it overseas and it's a night and day difference,\" said Dayne Rusch of Vyper Industrial.\n\nVyper's American-made stools and other shop equipment range in price from $350 to $650 while foreign-made alternatives can sell for less than $40, Rusch said.\n\nAt the National Hardware Show in March, Rusch said he was approached by many vendors asking if Vyper would consider manufacturing their products.\n\n\"There's a huge opportunity for OEM manufacturers to start taking on more work from these people that were purchasing overseas and start making it here in the United States,\" Rusch said.\n\nThe other sells that spoke to CNBC said it's not financially feasible to relocate manufacturing to the U.S., even though it would allow them to avoid tariffs.\n\nSome, like William Su, are moving manufacturing completely out of China, but staying overseas. Su set up a factory for his Teamson brand in Vietnam in reaction to China tariffs during Trump's first term. He's now in talks to manufacture in India. Trump hit both countries with significant tariffs last week, although they're temporarily on hold.\n\nSurrounded by her colorful baby products in California, Kenney told CNBC she considered opening her own manufacturing site.\n\n\"But that's way over my head and out of my budget,\" she said. \"I would love to be able to manufacture in the U.S., but the truth is that the infrastructure is not there.\"\n\nWith fewer factories in the U.S. than in China, Kenney said the cost to make her products domestically would be double or triple what she pays now.\n\n\"The people in China are hungry for the work,\" she said. \"They'll get back to you right away. They make sure you get your shipments right away. They're on it.\"\n\nEnding 'de minimis'\n\nThere is one tariff announcement Trump made that's a boon for U.S-based sellers like Kenney: closing the loophole known as \"de minimis.\"\n\nThis exemption allowed orders under $800 to avoid paying duties and taxes, and it's what made absurdly low prices possible on direct-from-China sites like Temu, Alibaba and Shein. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it processed more than 1.3 billion de minimis shipments in 2024, up from over 1 billion shipments in 2023.\n\nChinese sellers send small orders directly to U.S. customers to keep shipments under the $800 limit. U.S. sellers like Kenney don't often qualify for de minimis because they ship in large quantities by the pallet, bringing products to their warehouses for quality checks instead of shipping straight to customers from Chinese factories.\n\nKenney used to sell her most popular product, a set of six silicone baby spoons, for $9.99 on Amazon. She's reduced the price to $7.99 to compete with knockoffs that sell for as low as $3 on Temu.\n\n\"I've even had them rip off all of my photos and content that I've created and use it to sell their knockoff products,\" Kenney said.\n\nTrump briefly put de minimis on hold in February. Days later, he temporarily reinstated the loophole because huge numbers of Chinese packages started piling up at U.S. post offices and customs offices ill-equipped to collect duties at such a fast pace.\n\nThe president on April 2 again announced that he was ending de minimis, effective May 2.\n\nThe White House said \"adequate systems\" are now in place to collect tariffs. It added that the loophole is being closed to target \"deceptive\" Chinese-based shippers who \"hide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in low-value packages to exploit the de minimis exemption.\"\n\nForeman of Basic Fun said his Tonka Truck goes through many layers of inspection before landing on Amazon.\n\n\"Anything that comes in on de minimis is not going through that safety scrutiny at all,\" Foreman said. \"Small packets that might have included a dress or some kind of tchotchke might have been stuffed with illegal drugs or things like that, might be counterfeit, might be bootlegs or knockoffs.\"\n\nSome Amazon sellers were benefiting from de minimis, particularly on its separate direct-from-China site Amazon Haul, which launched in November to compete with Temu. But killing de minimis will be a net positive for Amazon because it will hurt competitors like Temu, said Ives at Wedbush Securities.\n\nDe minimis is a \"loophole that's been tugging at Amazon really for the last 18 months,\" Ives said.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how Trump's tariffs will shift in coming weeks and what tariffs other countries will impose on U.S. goods. Those pose a risk for Amazon and its U.S. merchants that sell to foreign customers.\n\n\"It just has a cascading impact across the entire economy,\" Goldberg of Publicis Groupe said. \"Uncertainty is really bad for business, regardless of who wins or loses on any specific tariff.\"",

The question is who blinks first.\n\n\"At the moment, Xi seems to be calculating that China can withstand the damage and that ultimately it's the United States who will blink first,\" said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis\n\nXi's view is that countries will want to do business less with the U.S. because of the uncertainty created by tariffs, which will drive them toward China, said Thomas, who added that China has been preparing for this possibility for years by growing trade relations with the rest of the world.\n\n\"Both Washington and Beijing think they hold the stronger hand for different reasons.

Experts say Beijing could ban more companies from doing business in China and further limit exports of critical materials, such as rare earth minerals.\n\nChina \"hasn't gone anywhere close to the maximum that it could do with its rare earth exports, considering it's such a dominant player in the industry,\" Thomas said.\n\nChina could \"shut down huge segments of high-tech supply chains\" by banning rare earth minerals, Thomas said, calling it \"a nuclear option that would severely damage not just the American economy but European and Asian economies.\"\n\nBeijing has also said it will restrict Hollywood films in China. While it's not a \"significant\" retaliation, Thomas said that \"it feeds right into Xi Jinping's broader political agenda to reduce foreign influence on Chinese society.\"\n\nBut Scott Kenney, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that Beijing believes Trump has already blinked by pausing the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days.\n\n\"I think the Chinese will read this as weakness from President Trump and they will wait,\" he said.",

                "body": "Amid the ongoing tariff war with Beijing, US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that he would love to get a deal with China to put an end to the escalating global trade turmoil.\n\nTrump made the comments during a Cabinet meeting after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that as they settle deals with countries, it will bring more certainty to trade policy.\n\nThe Republican leader also expressed confidence in his tariffs plan and said that the country might face some 'transitional problems' but things will soon fall into place.\n\nAlso Read | Donald Trump's tariff on China now stands at 145%. Here's how\n\n\"There'll be a transition cost, and transition problems, but in the end, it's going to be a beautiful thing,\" Trump said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting. \"We're in very good shape.\"\n\nThe US President's remark came hours after he hiked the tariff on Chinese imports to 145% from the 125% that kicked in on Wednesday.\n\nThe number, published in a White House memo, comes in addition to a 20 per cent levy put into place earlier this year over China's role in fentanyl trafficking.\n\nThe current US tariffs on Chinese imports include a 145 per cent duty on all products imported from China, 25 per cent tariffs on aluminium, automobiles, and goods from Canada and Mexico that do not fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and a 10 per cent levy on all other imported items.\n\nAlso Read | Will Donald Trump's tariffs push Apple to make iPhones in the US? Here's the answer\n\nOn Wednesday, the Republican leader announced a 90-day pause on 'reciprocal tariffs' on 'most nations' except China.\n\nDespite the respite, the US stock markets fell again on Thursday after gaining big on President Donald Trump's reprieve on tariffs to most countries.\n\nThe US's other trading partners will still face a 10% blanket import tax to allow a period to negotiate individual trade agreements. If that doesn't succeed, the higher duties are set to go into place on July 9.",

                "body": "To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.\n\nWell, President Trump's total base tariff on China is actually higher than the original number previously reported. For more, let's welcome in Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul. And we thought 125% was high, Ben.\n\nExactly. Yeah, it was a bit of a surprise this morning. So this comes after Trump and from officials from Trump on down had described yesterday's move as raising China's tariff rate to 125%. What we learned when the executive order was was released this morning that that only applied to the reciprocal tariff piece of that. That is indeed rising to 125%, but it doesn't include previous 20% tariffs on China that Trump imposed on over over issues of fentanyl. So that 125 plus 20 gets us to 145%. I will say, Julie, it's even higher than that when you factor in the sector by sector tariffs that came from Trump 1.0 and Biden augmented, which has been estimated to be sort of in the neighborhood of an additional 20% when you when you average it all out. Bottom line here is these are incredibly high tariffs on China that comes after yesterday where Trump pivoted in the opposite direction on the rest of the world. He he held back on reciprocal tariffs or additional reciprocal tariffs on on those countries and raised them here on China and it kind of gets to a point here that this trade war has really moved into being all about China here. It's that that's that's clearly what he's what he's said again and again and is has increased recently. Um this this I'd underline is two to three times, depending how you measure it, what Trump promised on the campaign trail. He talked about 60% tariffs on China and everyone thought that was bluster and that was too big. This this is so much higher than that. And the latest from Trump himself this afternoon at a cabinet meeting, he said, he wouldn't confirm whether or not he's meeting with China, or he's had any meetings with China since he announced these. And all I would say is kind of, we'll see what happens in terms of talks with the with the country.",

But the National Film Administration (NFA) in Beijing said on its website that Trump's tariffs would continue to sour its domestic demand for American movies in China.\n\n\"We will follow market rules, respect the audience's choices, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported,\" the NFA said on its website.\n\nChina was once looked to by Hollywood to help boost the box office performance of movies, since the former is the world's second-largest film market.\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE'LL 'TAKE A LOOK' AT EXEMPTING SOME LARGER US COMPANIES HIT ESPECIALLY HARD BY TARIFFS\n\nChina's domestic movies, though, are increasingly outperforming American movies shown in China.

That combined with a 20% \"fentanyl tariff\" already in place means some imports will be subject to a total tariff of 145%, CNBC first reported.\n\nAmerica buys more from China than any other country in the world, except Mexico -- to the tune of nearly $440 billion in 2024. All kinds of consumer goods come from China -- including electronics like iPhone, toys, clothes and shoes.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing its own 84% tariff rate on US goods, which took effect Thursday.\n\nThe US exported more than $143 billion worth of goods to China in 2024, including products like soybeans, aircraft and aircraft parts, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and vehicles.\n\nChinese exports rose a whopping 13% in 2023 and 17% in 2024. Exports make up about 20% of the country's GDP.\n\nMeanwhile, American exports -- which were higher than ever 10 years ago -- are slumping. Exports only account for 11% of the US GDP -- down from 13.6% in 2012.\n\nUS exports to China fell almost 3% last year, to a total of $144 billion, according to the US Trade Representative's Office.\n\nThe trade deficit between the two countries has also widened, reaching $295 billion.\n\nTrump initiated the 90-day pause with trading partners besides China in part due to a selloff in the bond market, and a decline in US stock indicies.\n\n\"I thought people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions,\" he told reporters Wednesday from the White House South Lawn at an event featuring NASCAR Cup Series champions Joey Logano and Ryan Blaney.\n\nMarkets had their best day since 2001 following the announcement, but ceded significant ground when trading resumed Thursday.",

                "title": "Why Xi won't budge on tariffs with Trump: China expert explains the standoff",
                "body": "The ongoing US-China trade war has intensified. On Thursday, the White House announced that the U.S. has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, further intensifying the ongoing trade war. The initial announcement on Wednesday set the tariff at 125%, but an additional 20% was later included due to China's alleged involvement in fentanyl production.As tensions in the US-China trade war escalate, Chinese President Xi Jinping finds himself in a difficult position, unable to make the economically rational move of negotiating directly with Donald Trump, according to China expert Gordon Chang.\n\nSpeaking on FOX Business, Chang explained that Xi's political standing within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) makes it nearly impossible for him to take a softer stance on tariffs, even if doing so would benefit China's struggling economy.\n\n\"Picking up the phone and calling President Trump would be the economically rational thing to do,\" Chang said on Mornings with Maria.\n\n\"But Xi Jinping has configured the Chinese political system in such a way that only the most hostile responses are considered acceptable, which means he has boxed himself in.\"\n\nXi's political survival depends on projecting strength and defiance rather than compromise.\n\nAny attempt to negotiate with Trump would invite internal criticism from party hardliners, who view the United States as an adversary that must be challenged, not accommodated.\n\nDespite China's tough rhetoric, many experts argue that Beijing has limited leverage in the trade war.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed China's latest tariff hikes as a \"loser\" move, pointing out that China exports five times more goods to the U.S. than it imports.\n\nChang echoed this sentiment, arguing that China is in a weak position compared to the U.S. \"They don't have any cards in this game,\" he said.\n\n\"While the Chinese are holding a pair of twos, Trump has a royal straight flush.\"\n\nThe key issue, according to Chang, is that China has overestimated its ability to pressure Trump into making concessions. \"The Chinese think, 'We can intimidate Trump, we can coerce him into surrendering preemptively,' but Trump is showing that he won't back down,\" he explained.\n\nThe latest round of tariff hikes has further deepened the standoff. The White House confirmed on Thursday that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports have been increased to 145%, escalating tensions in the ongoing trade war.\n\nInitially set at 125% on Wednesday, the tariff was later raised by an additional 20% in response to China's alleged role in fentanyl production.\n\nOn Wednesday, China raised tariffs on U.S. imports from 34% to 84% in response to Trump's hike to 104% on Chinese goods. Hours later, Trump retaliated again, raising tariffs to 125%.\n\nChinese officials have vowed to \"fight to the end\", signaling that there is no immediate resolution in sight.\n\nHowever, with China's economy already under pressure from slowing growth and capital flight, analysts believe that Beijing's ability to sustain this trade war is limited.\n\nWith neither side showing signs of backing down, the US-China trade war is expected to continue escalating, potentially leading to further economic disruptions.\n\nHowever, Chang believes that internal political constraints will keep Xi from making any major concessions, even if it means further economic hardship for China.\n\n\"The reality is that China is running out of options,\" he said. \"But Xi Jinping is more concerned with his political standing than with economic rationality.\"\n\nAs both sides dig in, the question remains: How much longer can China afford to play this game?\n\nAs per a report by AFP, in the latest round, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports have been increased to 145%.\n\nXi's political standing within the CCP requires him to project strength. Negotiating with Trump could be seen as a sign of weakness, exposing him to internal criticism from party hardliners.",

                "body": "Many sellers on Amazon count on China for manufacturing and assembly due to lower costs and established infrastructure - up to 70% of goods on Amazon come from China, according to Wedbush Securities. With nearly all imports from China being taxed a staggering 145% under the latest tariffs, Amazon sellers are having to decide whether to raise prices or absorb the vastly increased cost of importing their goods.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday told CNBC that its vast network of third-party sellers will likely \"pass the cost on\" to consumers. He added that Amazon has done some \"strategic forward inventory buys\" and looked to renegotiate terms on some purchase orders to keep prices low.\n\nAlthough Trump temporarily lowered tariffs on most countries to 10% on Wednesday, he doubled down on the huge tariffs on goods from China. Before the pause, average tariff rates under Trump were at the highest level since the Great Depression. The \"reciprocal tariffs\" were far steeper in regions like Southeast Asia. Tariffs also hit U.S. allies at unusual rates, including 20% on the European Union and previously announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\n\nJosianne Boisvert of Canadian-based Portable Winch Co. said she \"was in a state of shock\" when the tariffs were announced. For 20 years, the company has driven its products an hour to the U.S. border for duty-free shipping to American customers.\n\n\"We are questioning ourselves if we just move our focus to Europe,\" Boisvert said.\n\nCNBC talked to several Amazon sellers to find out how the new tariffs are having an impact on their decisions about prices and where to manufacture.",

                "title": "Trump's tariffs still risk inflation and recession as China trade war looms, experts say",
                "body": "U.S. stocks plunged on Thursday as investors digested Trump's tariff policy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to pause so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for most countries triggered a historic stock market rally on Wednesday, but the levies that remain in place are still expected to hike prices and put the U.S. at risk of a recession, experts told ABC News.\n\nAlongside the suspension of some tariffs, Trump increased duties on Chinese goods to a total of 145%, marking a significant escalation of a trade war between the two largest economies in the world.\n\nStock markets plunged on Thursday as investors digested Trump's tariff announcement, slashing roughly half of the previous day's rally.\n\nThe high tariffs on China, the third-largest U.S. trade partner, are expected to raise prices for an array of widely used products, including smartphones, shoes, clothes and video game systems, experts said.\n\nPlus, experts added, the extra costs for U.S. shoppers and a general sense of policy uncertainty increases the likelihood of an economic downturn.\n\n\"China is not the only country we trade with but they are an important trading partner for a lot of goods,\" Christopher Conlon, a professor of economics at New York University who studies trade, told ABC News.\n\nEven after Trump paused some tariffs, U.S. consumers face an average effective tariff rate of 25.2%, the highest since 1909, the Yale Budget Lab found in report on Thursday. An effective tariff rate factors in the impact of tariffs on imports of finished goods as well as inputs used by domestic firms.\n\nIn addition to the tariffs on Chinese goods, the White House kept in place an across-the-board tariff of 10% on nearly all imports. The U.S. also continues to impose 25% levies on foreign autos, aluminum and steel.\n\nGoods from Mexico and Canada face tariffs of 25%, though the measure excludes products covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.\n\nCurrent tariffs are expected to hike prices by an additional 2.7% in 2025, costing consumers on average about $4,400 per household over that time, the Yale Budget Lab said.\n\n\"Higher tariffs will push prices up significantly over the next year or so,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, told ABC News in a statement on Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House said U.S. tariffs on China stand at 145%, more than the 125% levy that had been widely reported a day earlier.\n\nAt the previous tariff level of 125% for Chinese goods, the cost of a nearly $60 car seat would've increased an average of $132.75 for a new price of about $192, according to the left-leaning Center for American Progress, or CAP. A Playstation 5 video game system, meanwhile, would've increased $623.75 for a new price of roughly $1,122, CAP found.\n\nUnder the current 145% tariffs, those price increases would rise further.\n\nSmartphone prices are also expected to rise, experts said. China accounted for more than four of every five of smartphones imported into the U.S. last year, S&P Global said in a note to clients on Thursday\n\nExperts told ABC News they anticipate price hikes will coincide with an elevated risk of a recession.\n\nThey pointed to risks of a slowdown for businesses mired in higher tax costs, as well as a shopping slump as consumers curtail spending to pad their savings to help weather price increases and a possible economic downturn.\n\n\"It was encouraging to see the President reverse himself on the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs yesterday, but I wouldn't take much solace in it as the global trade war continues to rage,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a post on X. \"I still put the odds of a recession this year at 60%.\"\n\nThe view echoed a note J.P.Morgan sent to clients hours after Trump's tariff pause on Wednesday.\n\n\"The drag from trade policy is likely to be somewhat less than before, and thus the prospect of a recession is a closer call,\" J.P.Morgan said. \"However, we still think a contraction in real activity later this year is more likely than not.\"\n\nFor now, the economy remains in solid shape by several key measures.\n\nThe unemployment rate stands at a historically low level. Meanwhile, inflation cooled in March, putting price increases well below a peak attained in 2022, fresh data on Thursday showed.\n\nMeanwhile, hiring surged in March, blowing past economists' expectations and accelerating job growth from the previous month.\n\nConlon, of New York University, said the likelihood of a recession eased after Trump's tariff pause but the risk of a downturn remains elevated.\n\n\"A lot of the permanent disruption and damage has been done, mostly because you'll see consumers and companies react to this uncertainty by pulling back,\" Conlon said. \"People will be way less likely to go out and make big-ticket purchases because of recession fears and that can be self-perpetuating.\"",

That combined with a 20% fentanyl tariff already in place means some imports will be subject to a total tariff of 145%, CNBC first reported.\n\nAmerica buys more from China than any other country in the world, except Mexico -- to the tune of nearly $440 billion in 2024. All kinds of consumer goods come from China -- including electronics like iPhone, toys, clothes and shoes.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing its own 84% tariff rate on US goods, which took effect Thursday.\n\nThe US exported more than $143 billion worth of goods to China in 2024, including products like soybeans, aircraft and aircraft parts, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and vehicles.\n\nChinese exports rose a whopping 13% in 2023 and 17% in 2024.

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- The idea of scaling back eye-watering \"reciprocal\" tariffs rattled around President Trump's head for several days after the April 2 announcement -- even as he told staff and reporters he was willing to go full-speed-ahead.\n\nTrump dramatically ordered a 90-day pause in imposing the higher rates on most countries Wednesday -- hours after they took effect -- claiming dozens of nations had pleaded for a reprieve to give them a chance to buy more US goods and eliminate trade barriers.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of Trump's closest advisers, had nudged the president Sunday to use the 12:01 a.m. Wednesday deadline to \"lock these people in\" to more advantageous trade relations, an administration official told The Post.\n\nBessent suggested that a golden opportunity lay before Trump to permanently reform and improve conditions for US companies that manufacture and export goods overseas.\n\nA second source close to the administration described Bessent as advocating a \"more measured approach\" while \"taking aim at China\" -- advice the president appeared to follow Wednesday by jacking the reciprocal tariff against Beijing up to 125% from an initial 34%.\n\nTrump left in effect a 10% baseline tariff on most imports -- as well as previously announced 25% levies on foreign-made cars, steel and aluminum.\n\nPrior to Wednesday, the White House had messaged publicly that Trump would not change course -- knocking down floated suggestions of a 90-day pause as \"fake news\" earlier this week -- projecting a resolve that administration officials now say helped build maximum leverage with trading partners.\n\nAs late as 24 hours before the Wednesday afternoon announcement, sources told The Post, Trump had told members of his own staff that the reciprocal rates -- including 17% on Israel, 20% on the European Union, 24% on Japan, 25% on South Korea, 26% on India, and 46% on Vietnam -- would not be paused.\n\nAs a result, many of Trump's own aides and top administration officials were caught off guard by the Wednesday pivot.\n\nHowever, after Trump and Bessent's Sunday chat, tightly held talks took place Monday morning about pausing all reciprocal duties other than those against China.\n\n\"What they're going to end up doing is a pause for everyone except China and maybe a few others. For this to work, it has to be done in installments. You can't write an entire book in a day. Chapter by chapter,\" the source close to the White House predicted Monday morning.\n\nThe same source, who described the process as \"art, not a science,\" added Thursday: \"There was always an understanding that [the administration] can pivot when needed. It's like football: you call a play with understanding that [you] likely at times need to adjust and take what the defense gives you at the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"Start with broad sweeping action, make the mission clear. And then narrow it strategically to put pressure on Beijing. And send the message: If you don't play ball, you'll get the China treatment too.\"\n\nThe treasury secretary confirmed to reporters Wednesday that he had spoken with Trump on Sunday but insisted that the pause was the president's \"strategy all along\" and Trump made the decision on his own.\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday that he made up his mind to pause tariffs after he looked at the \"queasy\" bond markets and \"yippy\" critics.\n\nHe said he didn't make the final decision until Wednesday morning, after which he sat down with Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and wrote a Truth Social post announcing the plan.\n\n\"I thought people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,\" Trump said.\n\nShortly after, Trump added: \"Over the last few days I've been thinking about it. I think it came together early this morning -- fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up. We didn't have access to lawyers. We wrote it up from our hearts.\"\n\nTrump has been the ultimate decider of the tariff strategy, from choosing the initial \"Liberation Day\" formula to Wednesday's announcement in pursuit of one-on-one \"tailor-made\" deals with dozens of nations.\n\nThe president's economic team, functioning more as a sounding board than advisers, had pitched Trump on several different formulas to use for his reciprocal tariff plan before he made the announcement in the White House Rose Garden, with some, like Bessent, advocating a more conservative, structured approach.",

The president announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all other countries.\n\nLast week, Trump and his team brokered a deal in which new investors would own 50 percent of a new TikTok entity, while Chinese owners would retain less than 20 percent, The New York Times reports.\n\nBeijing was comfortable with the deal, the Times reports, and a draft executive order outlining the it was circulating by Thursday.

Trump's order marked an extension from the original January 19 deadline, which Biden said he wouldn't enforce as it was his last full day in office.",

                "title": "Meme after meme: China targets Donald Trump and his advisers with AI war to counter tariffs; here are some causing a sensation",
                "body": "China's meme war is officially in full swing -- and this time, it's powered by artificial intelligence. As trade tensions with the U.S. grow sharper, Beijing is hitting back with a high-tech twist: viral AI-generated videos and memes mocking former President Donald Trump and his advisers, including Elon Musk and JD Vance. These digital jabs aren't just about humor -- they're part of a broader propaganda strategy meant to undermine America's new wave of tariffs and challenge the White House's push to revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nOne of the most widely shared clips shows Trump, Elon Musk, and Senator JD Vance assembling sneakers on a factory line. It's not just satire -- it's a dig at the U.S. administration's push for a \"Manufacturing Revival Plan.\" As tariffs soar, China is using AI memes to highlight the irony: nearly 62% of shoes sold in America are still imported from China, according to industry data. Only 1% are made domestically.\n\nThe clip has gone viral on TikTok and Chinese platforms like Weibo, mocking the idea that the U.S. could suddenly bring mass production back home. These videos tap into fears among Americans that tariffs will mean pricier goods -- especially when it comes to essentials like shoes and electronics.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted a digitally altered image of a \"Make America Great Again\" hat with a new price tag: $77, up from $50. The caption? A jab at how tariffs will hurt American wallets.\n\nAnother video shows a penguin wearing a red hat that reads \"Make America Go Away,\" while grumbling about taxes in Mandarin. The message behind all these memes? That U.S. consumers are the ones really paying the price for tariff policies.\n\nA separate AI music video, shared by Chinese state broadcaster CGTN, titled Look What You Taxed Us Through, slammed Trump's economic approach. The lyrics claim that tariffs \"killed our cheap Chinese cars\" and warned that \"low-income families take the hardest blow.\"\n\nThese memes are more than just jokes. They represent a new front in the trade war, one that blends digital warfare, satire, and viral media.\n\nChinese state-backed outlets are taking aim at America's trade stance with a blend of humor and defiance. In one older video repurposed from 1953, a revolutionary declared during the Korean War: \"We will never yield. We'll fight until we completely triumph.\" This clip was reshared by the Chinese Foreign Ministry to remind audiences of China's long-standing resistance to foreign pressure.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in the U.S. also reposted these videos, captioning them with a defiant warning: \"We don't back down.\"\n\nEven as China pushed back with memes and media, financial markets around the world saw a brief sigh of relief. On Thursday, Trump paused most planned tariff hikes for 90 days -- though not on China.\n\nGlobal markets rallied in response:\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Trump's pause \"an important step towards stabilising the global economy.\" Still, analysts warned that uncertainty remains. Deutsche Bank noted that a 10% universal tariff could still become the biggest trade disruption in decades.\n\nDespite all the talk, manufacturing jobs haven't flooded back to the U.S. as hoped. Devlin Carter, founder of luxury footwear company SIA Collective, told NBC News that tariffs \"make no sense\" and hurt small businesses like his. His company still manufactures in China due to lower costs.\n\nEconomist Peter Schiff added: \"Nike won't build factories in the U.S. to make sneakers. That would add more cost than the 40 percent tariffs.\"\n\nPepper Harward, CEO of Oka Brands, explained that the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure for a shoe industry anymore: \"Everybody's interested in U.S. manufacturing, but very few are committed.\"\n\nChris Rogers from S&P Global predicted it could take \"a couple of years at minimum\" to shift supply chains back to the States.\n\nChina remains openly critical. Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yongqian denounced the tariffs as \"blackmail,\" warning they \"severely impact the stability of the global economic order.\" She urged the U.S. to engage in talks based on \"mutual respect.\"\n\nMinistry official Lin Jian added: \"The U.S. cause doesn't win the support of the people and will end in failure.\"\n\nStill, Trump doubled down. \"China wants to make a deal, they just don't know how quite to go about it,\" he said, describing President Xi Jinping as a \"proud man\" who would eventually come around.\n\nBut with both sides digging in and memes spreading like wildfire online, one thing is clear: this isn't just a trade war anymore. It's a meme war, and China's AI arsenal has just started firing.\n\nWhy is China using memes to hit back at Trump's tariffs?\n\nTo mock U.S. tariff plans and show how they hurt American buyers.\n\nWhat's the message behind the AI videos of Trump and Musk in factories?\n\nThey highlight how unrealistic it is for the U.S. to bring back mass manufacturing.",

                "body": "\"I would say right now China is not exactly thrilled about signing it (a deal to sell TikTok assets), but we have a deal with some very good people, some very rich companies that would do a great job with it,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's tariff on Chinese goods is now at 145%, the White House clarified on Thursday. The 125% tariffs announced Wednesday adds to the previously imposed 20% tariffs implemented by Trump back in February. In response, China struck back with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods, which went into effect on Thursday.\n\nLas week on Friday, April 4, Trump signed an executive order to once again extend the deadline of a ban on TikTok in the United States. The 75-day ban ends on June 18.\n\nU.S. TikTok users remember all too well when TikTok went briefly dark in January, when the short-form video app was removed from app stores and internet hosting services made the platform inaccessible. To combat the ban, Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20 extending the ban's deadline. That extension was set to expire Saturday, April 5 before Trump extended the deadline again.\n\nAlso last week, Trump shared that a deal was in the works to create a new company that would house and manage TikTok's U.S. assets, as reported by Reuters. The company would be operated by a majority of U.S. investors and ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, would hold a minority position of under 20%. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that the deal was approved by existing investors, who have so far remained unnamed, ByteDance and the U.S. government.\n\nAs of Thursday, no official deals have been announced.\n\nWhy is TikTok facing a ban?\n\nIn spring 2024, former President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which gave ByteDance until Jan. 19, 2025 to divest TikTok. Some political officials have seen TikTok as a national security threat for years, expressing concern that ByteDance may be sharing U.S. user data with the Chinese government. ByteDance has repeatedly denied these claims, which thus far remain unsubstantiated.\n\nThough previously in favor of banning TikTok, especially during his first administration, Trump said he could \"save\" the app after winning the 2024 presidential election.\n\nDuring the short-lived January shutdown, Trump told internet hosting services and app stores that they could restore TikTok and not face legal penalties. Internet hosting services rebooted the platform almost immediately, but the Google Play Store and Apple App Store waited until the following month to restore access.\n\nUnder federal legislation, companies could be fined $5,000 per user they help access TikTok. For companies like Google and Apple, this could mean a $5,000 fine for each user who downloads or updates TikTok.\n\nHow many times could Trump extend the deadline?\n\nUnder federal legislation, the president can implement a 90-day extension of the deadline in order for a sale to be finalized. However, Trump didn't take this route in January. Instead, he signed the first executive order delaying the ban by 75 days.\n\nIf he wishes to sign yet another executive order in another 75 days, he can.\n\nWho are TikTok's suitors?\n\nSeveral individuals, companies and consortiums have expressed interest in purchasing TikTok. Most recently, Amazon and the founder of adult content website OnlyFans have thrown their hats into the ring.\n\nOn April 2, Tim Stokely, OnlyFans' founder, told Reuters that his startup Zoop had partnered with cryptocurrency organization The HBAR Foundation to submit a bid for TikTok. Reuters also reported last week that an unnamed U.S. administration official had confirmed that Vice President JD Vance and Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had received a letter of interest from Amazon.\n\nAmazon, Zoop, The HBAR Foundation nor TikTok immediately responded for comment when contacted by USA TODAY on Thursday.\n\nHere's who else has expressed interest in the platform over the past year:",

                "body": "The move follows a new executive order from Donald Trump raising tariffs on China to 125%, up from 84%.\n\nThe United States has escalated its tariff war with China, as the White House confirmed Thursday that total US tariffs on Chinese imports now stands at 145 per cent, CNBC reported.\n\nThe move follows a new executive order from Donald Trump raising tariffs to 125 per cent, up from 84 per cent. It also includes an additional 20 per cent tariff specifically targeting fentanyl-related imports, previously imposed on China, pushing the cumulative tariff rate up'.\n\nTrump on Wednesday reversed his sweeping tariffs on most nations for at least 90 days. However, he ramped up pressure on China, on which the pause does not apply, further escalating a high-stakes confrontation between the world's two largest economies, who have traded tit-for-tat tariff hikes repeatedly over the past week.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nBeijing: \"Door remains open, but not to threats\"\n\nMeanwhile, China refused to back down against America's aggression, and its 84 per cent tariffs on US imports came into effect at 12.01 pm on Thursday, according to the Chinese state news agency, Xinhua.\n\nChina has vowed to resist what it calls \"coercive\" tactics. A Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson reiterated Thursday that while Beijing remains open to dialogue, it will only negotiate on the basis of mutual respect and equality.\n\n\"Pressure, threats, and coercion are not the right way to deal with China,\" said the spokesperson, adding that China's response would continue \"to the end\" if provoked.\n\nAlso read | 'Won't sit back': China says it doesn't fear more US levies, reaches out to EU, ASEAN\n\nIn a show of defiance, China's foreign ministry accused the US of \"bullying\" and warned that Trump's approach would end in failure.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTrade war\n\nThe looming slugfest between the world's two largest economies is casting a dark shadow over global trade, with analysts raising the spectre of an American recession.\n\nChina and the United States edged dangerously close to a full-blown trade war on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a staggering 104 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports. Locked in an escalating showdown, neither side showed signs of backing down -- with Beijing vowing to resist US pressure \"to the end.\"\n\nTrump initially imposed a 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, which was swiftly met with an equivalent retaliatory measure by Beijing. In response, the US added another 50 per cent in duties. When combined with earlier levies from February and March, the total tariff burden on Chinese imports under Trump's second term now stands at 104 per cent, bringing fears of a near-embargo scenario.\n\nIn February, Donald Trump slapped a 10 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods with no carve-outs, citing Beijing's alleged role in fuelling illegal immigration and facilitating the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Last month, he doubled those rates -- a move that sent shockwaves through global markets and deepened already strained US-China relations.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nChina, which was America's second-largest source of imports last year, shipped $439 billion worth of goods to the US, compared to $144 billion in American exports to China. The rising tariffs now threaten to hit domestic industries hard, with businesses warning of cost surges, layoffs, and reduced competitiveness.",

Chinese President Xi Jinping is pictured\n\nThe S&P 500 stock index jumped 9.5 percent after the announcement, but the drama over Trump's tariffs is far from over as the administration prepares to engage in country-by-country negotiations. In the meantime, countries subject to the pause will now be tariffed at 10 percent.\n\nThe president hit pause in the face of intense pressure created by volatile financial markets that had been pushing Trump to reconsider his tariffs, even as some administration officials insisted the his reversal had always been the plan.\n\nThe global economy appeared to be in open rebellion against Trump's tariffs as they took effect early Wednesday, a signal that the US president was not immune from market pressures.\n\nBy early afternoon, Trump posted on Truth Social that because more than 75 countries had reached out to the U.S. government for trade talks and had not retaliated in meaningful ways, 'I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.'\n\nTrump later told reporters that he pulled back on many global tariffs -- but not on China -- because people were 'yippy' and 'afraid' due to the stock market declines. He added that while he expected to reach deals, 'nothing's over yet.'",

That was before Trump hiked his tariffs up higher to 125% plus existing tariffs, however, and it's unclear if Beijing could further raise its tariffs on the U.S. in response.\n\nIn addition to the tariffs on Chinese imports, the Trump administration has also kept in place a baseline 10% tariff on most foreign imports, even as it paused higher tariffs on many countries' goods for 90 days while the White House negotiates with other countries. Tariffs also remain in place on goods from Canada and Mexico, as Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 25% on a range of goods from those countries that are not exempted under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell nearly 1,500 points, or more than 3.6%. The 10-year Treasury yield, (^TNX) in high focus amid bond market whiplash, fell to around 4.35%.\n\nThe major averages sank to session lows after the White House confirmed updated tariff figures released on Thursday brings the total increased levies on Chinese goods to 145%, not 125% as previously stated.\n\nWall Street has been weighing Trump's remarkable escalation in the US trade battle with China while pausing levies on many US trading partners.\n\nMarkets on Wednesday had breathed a loud, collective sigh of relief after Trump paused many of the largest US tariff hikes on a list of countries, with stocks notching one of their biggest one-day rallies since World War II.\n\n\"The trade war is now turning into a direct confrontation between the US and China ... we could again be seeing escalation and de-escalation at the same time, pulling markets in different directions,\" Rabobank analysts said.\n\nAnd though a wider trade war is on hiatus, risks remain to the health of the US economy, and Trump's move is \"merely the end of the beginning,\" according to JPMorgan.\n\nOther parts of the president's trade-policy overhaul are still in effect, including a 10% baseline tariff on most trading partners, 25% duties on steel and aluminum imports, and 25% duties on auto imports. Those elements could still lead to consequences analysts have warned about, such as rising prices and slower economic growth.\n\nRead more: Live updates on Trump tariffs fallout\n\nThe release of March's Consumer Price Index showed inflation pressures eased last month, increasing 2.5% on an annualized basis, less than what economists had expected.
